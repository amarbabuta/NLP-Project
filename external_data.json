We are committed to maintaining an enabling policy framework to attract foreign direct investment,\u0094 he said.He said the Vision 2025 mapped Pakistan to join the top 25 economies in the world leading to Upper Middle Income country status by 2025.He said the country\u0092s economy was targeted to grow over 8 percent between 2018 and 2025 while maintaining single digit inflation.He mentioned that PricewaterhouseCoopers had placed Pakistan at 20 in its projected list of 32 most powerful economies of the world in 2030.The prime minister said as a result of sustained commitment to reform, key economic indicators had improved since the government was elected in 2013.Over the past three years, the government brought down the fiscal deficit from 8.6 to 4.2 percent, increased Tax-to-GDP ratio from 9.8 to 12.4 percent and investment to GDP ratio from 14.9 to 15.2 percent, he added.He mentioned that inflation had been contained which had earlier touched 1.6 percent in October 2015 and had remained well under 3 percent since then.He said industrial sector showed remarkable performance and registered a growth of 6.8 percent during 2015-16 and was poised to do even better this year and onwards.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said since he came into office in 2013, the economy faced severe energy shortages, inflationary pressures, exchange rate volatility and a precarious security environment.He said however at present, the consumer market in Pakistan was growing at a very fast pace including automobiles, housing, electronics, telecommunication, hospitality and online-retails sectors.He said Pakistan was emerging as an expanding market for the US and European products.He mentioned that the government had devised a comprehensive plan to create investment friendly environment, particularly liberalized investment policies to welcome foreign investments.\u0093We offer incentives to attract new capital inflows, including tax exemptions, tariff reductions, infrastructure, and investor facilitation services,\u0094 he said.He said the Investment Policy (2013) focused at reducing the cost of doing business in Pakistan, easing business with creation of industrial clusters and Special Economic Zones to attract foreign direct investment, all protected by legislation.Nawaz Sharif said Pakistan Stock Exchange had been created to lower fragmentation of the market and bring it at par with global markets.\u0093The bench mark index PSE100, crossed 49,000 in January 2017 and is touching new heights. Recently, 40 percent strategic shares of Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) were sold to a Chinese consortium,\u0094 he added.He pointed that this divestment was the first such sale in a bourse in the regional markets and it also marks first venture of Chinese bourse outside China.The PM also apprised the foreign businessmen of Pakistan\u0092s strategic location on Asia\u0092s premier trade, energy and transport corridor.\u0093It is also the gateway to the energy rich Central Asian States, the financially liquid Gulf States and the economically advanced Far Eastern economies,\u0094 he said.He said China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was a key regional initiative for connectivity and shared prosperity of nations.He said under CPEC, a portfolio of over US$55 billion had already been implemented while investment of more than US$35 billion in the energy sector was also being implemented.He said the corridor would substantially shorten transportation distances between Africa and Middle-East to Central and South Asian regions.The prime minister said international economic agencies were upgrading ratings for the financial and economic stability of Pakistan.He mentioned that Standard &amp; Poor (S&amp;P) had upgraded its forecast of average annual GDP growth from 4.7 to 5 percent, World Bank forecast a GDP growth of 5.2 percent for 2016-17, S &amp; P also expected Pakistan\u0092s debt to fall below 60 percent of GDP by 2018.The CEOs from UK included Henry Cookson, MD Henry Cookson Adventures, Britain; Julia Charlotte Chastel De Boinville, Clint Programme Manager Afiniti; George Justin Murray, MD Afiniti; Christopher Malcolm Farmer, EVP Afiniti; Thomas Hampden Inskip, MD Afiniti; Archibald Soames, Sr Manager Afiniti; Julian Lopez Portillo, Client Programme Manager Afiniti and Max Cooper Lintott, Client Program Manager Afiniti.The business leaders from USA included Muhammad Ziaullah Khan Chishti, CEO the Resource Group and Hassan Afzal, Chief Technology Officer Afiniti.The business leaders from Italy included Alessandro Benetton, CEO Benetton Autostrade Pvt Equity; Carlo D\u0092 Amelio, CEO Sant\u0092 Anna-Holding Ibl Bancal-Spa; Fabio Corsico, Govt Affairs Director Kolon Group; Marco Alvera, CEO Snam; Cecilia Braggiotti, MD Afiniti and Lucia Baresi, Client Programme Manager Afiniti.The CEOs from China included Sichen Huang, Afiniti Advisor; Guo Ping, CEO Huawei; Linchun Chin, Youghi Yang, Jin Yi Hugo Ou, Non ED Sinolink Worldwide Holdings, China.The CEOs from other countries included Raymond Lee, Owner Kolon Group (South Korea); Rob Rankin, Chairman Consolidated Press Holdings and Roy Wyatt Beau, Client Programme Manager Afiniti (Australia); Lai Chang Wen, CEO Ninja Van and Li Huanwu, GM Afiniti and Hua Qianni, Centre Director (East China) (Singapore Consulate); Tanguy Catlin, Senior Partner Mckinsey and Jerome Geo.M.F.de la Croix de Castries, Country Manager Afiniti (France); Alonso Aznar Botella, Silent Programme Manager (Spain); Benedict Constantin Faber, GM Afiniti (Germany); Michel Grorges Portenier, EVP Afiniti (Switzerland); Timothy Gordon Raymond Nixon, GM Afiniti (Canada); Justyna Hanna Kozicki (Sweden) and Ali Raza Siddiqi, Director JS Group and Nadeem A.

Two industry sources said it was rescued thanks to the involvement of Putin and Modi while three other sources said Rosneft had simply outbid Saudi Aramco.Officials in Modi's office declined to comment while Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied there was any Kremlin intervention in the deal.\"Naturally, we defend the interests of our companies. Of course we lobby for them, especially on such large deals,\" said Peskov, but added that in the case of Essar \"there were no orders from the Kremlin\".\"It was a corporate decision by Rosneft to gain synergies via cooperation with India,\" he said.Rosneft and Saudi Aramco declined to comment.Essar said it had held discussions with several potential buyers but had gone with the Rosneft consortium because their offer was considered the most attractive. It denied there was any intervention from Putin or Modi.strong>SHOWDOWN</strongRosneft boss Igor Sechin is keen to buy refining assets around the world to guarantee outlets for Russian oil. He had been negotiating since 2014 to buy 49 percent of Essar from its owners, Indian brothers Ravi and Shashi Ruia, and the two parties had been in exclusive talks since July 2015 when a preliminary deal was signed.While the exact amount Rosneft was prepared to offer for the stake at that stage is unclear, Russian and Indian industry sources said it valued the whole of Essar at about $5.7 billion.However it became apparent that there were problems with the deal in early September, when Sechin travelled to India to meet the Ruia brothers, flying from Hangzhou, China, where he had been part of Putin's G20 summit delegation.Sechin walked into the meeting with the Ruia brothers soon after landing in India at 1 a.m., determined to close the deal, according to sources briefed on the discussions.As the meeting started, one of the brothers told Sechin the deal process had been going on for too long, the exclusivity period had expired in July and Essar was now talking to other parties.Those other parties included Saudi Aramco, he said.According to the sources familiar with how the meeting unfolded, Sechin responded by saying that if Essar walked away from the deal it risked losing Russian financial and oil-supply support.The Ruia brothers then said the talks with Rosneft were over and called an abrupt end to the meeting.\"People started leaving the room, embarrassed,\" one of the sources said. Another source said the Essar management had drafted a statement to say the deal with Rosneft was off.Rosneft and Essar declined to comment on what transpired at the meeting, or on whether such a statement had existed. Sechin and the Ruia brothers could not be reached for comment.Three Saudi-based sources familiar with details of talks between Essar and Saudi Aramco said the firm was seriously considering buying Essar. One of the sources said Aramco was prepared to pay up to $9 billion for all or most of the refiner.Aramco declined to comment on whether it had made a bid.strong>TOO BIG TO FAIL</strongIn the end, however, the Rosneft-Essar deal proved to be too big to fail.For India, a deal collapse or a delay because of talks with another party would set back Modi's drive to clean up India's $140 billion mountain of bad debt given Essar's multi-billion-dollar debts to local and foreign banks after years of rapid expansion.For Russia, the deal in the huge Indian market represented an important milestone in building a global oil empire despite Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine.Facing the Saudi competition, Rosneft formed a consortium that bought 98 per cent of the refiner plus a fuel terminal for $13 billion. The Kremlin oil firm bought 49 percent - below the 50 percent level that would have fallen foul of Western sanctions - with Swiss trading house Trafigura and Russian private investment group UCP buying the other 49 percent.According to the Indian and Russian industry sources, Rosneft and Essar returned to the negotiating table within days of the spat in early September, and the deal was finally struck.One of the sources said there was a fierce battle between Essar and Rosneft over the terms. They said the Russian-led consortium was forced to outbid the Saudi offer, which they said comprised a combination of cash, long-term low interest credit and oil supplies.Trafigura declined to comment on how the deal came together, while UCP did not reply to a written request asking for comment. Washington said the deal did not violate sanctions.The deal was signed in Mauritius on Oct. 14, a day before a formal announcement on the sidelines of a BRICS summit in Goa where Putin and Modi met. The leaders also oversaw the signing of a raft of other transactions including India agreeing to pay $5 billion for Russian long-range air defence missile systems.Two industry sources said the Essar deal had first been discussed by Putin and Modi as far back as May 2014 on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, Russia's main investor show.It was unclear what form - if any - high-level government intervention might have taken after the September dispute.But the two sources said that without political will in Moscow and New Delhi, an agreement could not have been struck.\"Putin and Modi saved that deal,\" said one.", "label": 0}, "external-5": {"text": "strong>GENEVA/LONDON: In a packed Christie's auction room in Geneva, one could hear a pin drop as two anonymous bidders slugged it out in their quest to own the world's most exquisite blue diamond.</strongThe room in the Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues was filled with multi-millionaire collectors and diamond dealers, listening intently as the bidders, each speaking by phone to a Christie's representative, took turns adding a few hundred thousand dollars in a tense struggle dragging on for more than half an hour.When the auctioneer's hammer came down, spontaneous applause broke out as the winner, who retained anonymity, bought the 14.62-carat Oppenheimer Blue for a world record $57.5 million for any jewel sold at auction. The sale some weeks ago was the latest in a series of world record prices per carat paid at auction for extraordinarily magnificent and rare diamonds.With new fortunes being created around the world faster than at any time in history, more of this expanding elite of wealthy investors are looking at different ways of protecting cash that now earns close to zero percent interest in bank accounts, while asset market turbulence can wipe out millions in hours.Some are eyeing rare diamonds as a best friend, or long-term haven at least. And it's no longer just a top table of \"super rich\" billionaires who are gravitating to this arcane world.A second division of wealthy is emerging. They can't afford the Oppenheimer Blue, perhaps, but they can take a stake in rare diamonds via specialist investment funds.strong>PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS' CLUB ONLY</strongThese gem specialists are keen to play up rare diamonds as \"safety\" investments, or at least a way to hedge against currency, stock and bond market volatility at a time of political and economic uncertainty. Britain's shock vote last month to leave the European Union underlines their point.\"The big players are looking at diamonds in a different way,\" said Ehud Laniado, chief executive of Cora International, which sold the 12.03-carat Blue Moon diamond for $48.4 million at a Sotheby's Geneva sale in November, a world record for any jewel sold at auction at the time.\"They are not looking at them just as a jewel, but as an asset that has a resale value.\"Citigroup said the outlook for gold remained uncertain partly due to concerns about a possible increase in U.S. interest rates. In such a scenario, investors may look at a next-best alternative such as diamonds.However, the diamond investors' club is shut to most ordinary savers due to its complicated, insider nature - characterised by poor liquidity, a lack of price transparency and high fees. While some are making efforts to create a liquid market, the process has been slow.Entry level for Sciens Coloured Diamond Fund II, one of the more established closed-end funds now shut to new investors, is $1 million. It invests in diamonds in rare colours such as red.The fund, which manages around $50 million, uses trading and buy-and-hold strategies for long-term appreciation. One of its strategies is to improve the value of stones by finding a rare matching pair in the same colour, size and shape. They are eventually sold to buyers such as jewellers and collectors.Some funds also loan diamonds to jewellers who wish not to maintain a large inventory. If the jeweller decides to make a unique ring for a client, he can buy a diamond from the fund.The Sciens fund, launched in 2014, rose in value by about 5 percent in the second quarter of 2016, said Philip Baldwin, managing director of Sciens Diamond Management BV. He and Mahyar Makhzani run the fund, based on the Caribbean island of Curacao.\"Colour diamonds are considered a safe haven,\" he said. \"Colour diamonds are a hedge against inflation, currency risk, market fluctuations and political uncertainty.\"Solitaire Diamond Co, another diamond-backed fund now closed to new investors, is backed by an assortment of white diamonds of high-grade clarity and cut weighing under 5 carats, which are certified by international laboratories such as the Gemological Institute of America.Fred Sinclair-Brown, Solitaire fund manager, said it made a gross margin of 20 percent over the past 12 months, above expectations of 14 to 16 percent. He said he was planning another diamond fund for professional investors, this time possibly backed by coloured gems.strong>INVESTORS SEE SPARKLE IN COLOUR GEMS</strongPrices of vivid and intense colour diamonds have risen 10 to 12 percent a year on average since 1959, according to Baldwin. However, dealers said white diamond prices had not gained as quickly in recent years and were largely flat in 2016.The most prominent white diamond to come to auction recently, the 1,109-carat Lesedi la Rona, failed to sell at Sotheby's in London last month, highlighting that diamond markets are not bulletproof.Diamond markets slowed in the second quarter as selective buyers pushed for deeper discounts. Polished inventory continued to rise and prices came under pressure, while rough trading remained resilient.Despite a handful of diamond-backed initiatives, fund managers have struggled over the years to find the right investment vehicles for diamonds due to illiquidity, a lack of price transparency and high transaction fees.\"I am very dubious about diamond-backed investment because the price of diamonds is not listed anywhere and the market is too illiquid,\" said Edmund Shing, strategist at BNP Paribas and former global equity fund manager of BCS Asset Management.Fund managers pointed to very separate markets for white diamonds. While white diamonds can be correlated to the commercial market for bridal jewellery, colour gems are in a unique investment category. Part of the problem with diamond investing is that different categories make it difficult to compile generic prices.A recent Citigroup poll found that about one-third of the respondents were willing to invest in a diamond product having homogeneity and liquidity.Martin Rapaport, head of the Rapaport Group, which has its own polished diamond price list widely used by the trade, is trying to create a more liquid market for investment-grade diamonds by developing a transparent price structure. He hopes to launch a fund backed by diamonds within a couple of years.\"Diamonds can be a good investment, but you have to be careful,\" he told Reuters. \"You need to know the bid/ask spread, the price you can sell diamonds back on the same day.\"", "label": 0}, "external-6": {"text": "strong>KARACHI: Fakhar Zaman slammed a spectacular century to help Khyber Pakhtunkhwa demolish Punjab by 151 runs in the final of Pakistan Cup 2016 at Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad, on Sunday.</strongIn the day-night decider, Fakhar (115) and Ahmed Shehzad (62) gave a rapid start to enable KP to pile up 311-9 in the allotted 50 overs.Spinners Yasir Shah (3-26) and Zohaib Khan (3-23) then bowled superbly to dismiss Punjab for 160 in 36.1 overs.KP had also lifted the Pentangular Cup in January 2015 when they defeated Balochistan by six wickets in the final under the captaincy of Junaid Khan in Karachi.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) this season named this event as Pakistan Cup by making some changes.Younis Khan won a vital toss and quite rightly elected to bat first on a pitch that was full of runs.In-form openers Shehzad (62) and Fakhar (115) provided an opening stand of 118 in 15.4 overs.Left-arm spinner Kashif Bhatti finally broke the partnership when he had Shehzad stumped by Mohammad Rizwan. The decision was given through a referral.Shehzad, who seemed in elegant touch, smacked two sixes and seven fours in his fiery 45-ball knock.Shehzad finished the event as the highest scorer with 372 runs, including three fifties and a superb 143.Younis promoted left-handed all-rounder Zohaib Khan (12) in the batting order but he departed early. Shoaib Malik had Zohaib caught at deep square-leg by Amad Butt when he attempted a slog sweep.Zohaib, who struggled against Malik, faced 27 deliveries.Fakhar was held at short mid-on by substitute Asif Ali off Test pacer Ehsan Adil after the Mardan-born player had cracked the fourth century of his career.Fakhar hit Shoaib for a four towards mid-off to complete his hundred. He struck three huge sixes and 12 fours in his 111-ball feat. He ended the event as the second highest scorer with 297 runs, which included one century and two fifties.Fakhar added 52 with Younis (49) for the third wicket.Younis and Fahim Ashraf (31) added 57 for the fourth wicket before Ehsan dismissed the latter to leave KP at 265-4 in 44 overs.Fahim struck three fours and a six from 37 balls. Musadiq Ahmed (19) used long handle, hitting two fours and one six in his rapid ten-ball knock.Younis smacked one six from 59 balls before being caught by Shan Masood off Amad as KP lost four wickets off the last 13 balls.Young all-rounder Amad was the pick of the bowlers with 3-55 in ten overs. Ehsan and Aamer Yamin remained expensive with figures of 2-75 in ten overs and 1-49 in six, respectively.Punjab had a poor start when left-arm pacer Zia-ul-Haq removed Salman Butt (0) and Aamer (1) in quick succession to leave them at 29-2 in 7.2 overs.Asad Shafiq (16) also fell early, held excellently by Fakhar at short-cover off the bowling of Fahim. Asad struck three fours from 15 balls.Left-arm spinner Mohammad Asghar got the prized scalp of Shan Masood (36). Asghar tossed it up, it swung in sharply, Shan went on back-foot to cut it, missed it completely before it crashed the stumps. Shan hit five fours from 40 balls. Punjab were gasping at 55-4 in the 13th over.Shoaib (24) and Rizwan (22) tried to consolidate the innings, but at 97, Test-leggie Yasir Shah had the Punjab captain caught by Fahim in the deep. Malik smashed one six and two fours from 26 deliveries.Left-arm spinner Zohaib dislodged Rizwan and Amad (0) in his first over to leave Punjab tottering at 107-7 in the 23rd over.Fahim took his third catch when he held Rizwan at point after the international stumper had smacked two fours from 33 balls. Yasir removed Saif Badar (10).Zulfiqar Babar (29) and Kashif Bhatti (15) extended KP\u0092s wait for celebration as they added 36 for the ninth wicket before Zohaib sent back the former, trapped lbw.Zulfiqar struck two sixes and one four from 32 balls.

It has already bid for 840 billion Indian rupees ($12.5 billion) in government contracts, senior executives said, though it hasn't yet won any of those.The success of the strategy will depend partly on whether he can persuade government officials and international partners that he can build sophisticated equipment and partly on whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi can get India's notoriously slow procurement process to work.Modi has made defence a big part of his \"Make in India\" programme. As part of any defence contract, he is demanding foreign companies tie up with a local partner, transfer technology and move some manufacturing to India.At stake is $250 billion in defence contracts the government is expected to award over the next 10 years as it looks to upgrade the military's aging equipment. \"We hope to have a significant share of this pie,\" said R K Dhingra, chief executive of Reliance Defence. He predicted the company will \"emerge as a key player in the defence sector over the next few years.\"Reliance's ambition is greeted with scepticism by many in the defence world. An military official involved in defence procurement said Reliance is overreaching in wanting to make everything from ships to planes. Some rivals and potential partners for the contracts said Reliance will struggle to master the manufacture of such a wide range of sophisticated military hardware.\"There is no quick money in this branch,\" said Jan Widerstrom, head of Saab India Technologies, a unit of Saab AB. \"It requires a lot of experience, high tech culture, investments and a long-term business plan.\"Still, Saab and Reliance are working together in developing the next generation Combat Management System for the Indian Navy and Coast Guard.Recently, Reliance's lack of experience and questions about its ability to handle sensitive technology and intellectual property counted against it in its bid to partner with the Russians to build 200 Kamov helicopters, said a Russian diplomat in New Delhi, who declined to be identified in this story because they weren't speaking in an official capacity.The contract, estimated to be worth a little over $900 million went instead to Indian state-controlled company Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.Ambani should identify core areas and concentrate on them rather than \"be an inch deep and a mile wide,\" said Nitin Gokhale, founder of defence website Bharat Shakti.strong>RELIANCE GROUP</strongThe Reliance conglomerate split into two in 2005 after a bitter feud between Anil Ambani and his older brother, Mukesh. The latter got the flagship Reliance Industries, with interests in petrochemicals, oil and gas exploration, refining and textiles.Anil got telecoms, power, entertainment and financial services businesses. But some of his businesses struggled, especially an ill-timed foray into infrastructure, and debt piled up.Its Reliance Infrastructure arm, which includes the defence operations, aims to be debt free in the current financial year ending March 2017, according to Lalit Jalan, who is acting CEO of the unit.To get there it plans to sell assets, including road projects and a stake in a power distribution company for about 180 billion rupees, according to another senior Reliance executive. Ambani entered the defence sector last year, when he took a controlling stake in a company that made warships and energy exploration vessels, in Modi's home state of Gujarat, called Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Co Ltd, for about 20 billion Indian rupees.That became Reliance Defence and Engineering Ltd. Since then, Reliance has bought hundreds of acres of additional land to build an aerospace facility and another shipyard in other parts of the country.It has also signed more than half a dozen joint venture agreements with foreign companies, including one with Rafael Advanced Defence Systems of Israel, to bid for Indian government contracts as they come up.An Israeli defence industry source said for Rafael the idea is that if it wins tenders, Reliance will produce some components for missiles and other systems.strong>BUILDING EXPERIENCE</strongAmbani has said that lack of experience is being held against his company.\"Despite a committed reformist mindset at the top, we are still seeing opportunities being denied to new players on grounds of lack of experience,\" Ambani told a 'Make in India' summit on defence in March.Reliance Defence has been building an experienced team. Dhingra earlier headed Lockheed Martin's India operations, and the company has hired a slew of senior army and navy officers who have executed large defence projects from conception to delivery, the Reliance executive said.The group's experience in managing complex projects in India, including building roads and power plants should help it, the executive said. For design, technology and complicated weaponry, Reliance would have a foreign partner, he noted.Reliance expects to spend up to 20 billion rupees over the next three years in upgrading facilities as it gets business, keeping its outlay low as it waits for contracts, the executive said.Thanks to its Pipavav shipyard, Reliance expects the naval part of its business to be the first to take off, he said. It plans to bid for a $7.5 billion submarine contract that the government is expected to give out to replace the navy's ageing and accident-prone fleet and narrow the gap with rival China's rapidly modernizing fleet.Ambani also has plans to bid for contracts in the future to make nuclear-powered submarines.($1 = 67.3 Indian rupees)", "label": 0}, "external-8": {"text": "strong>LONDON/JAKARTA: Some of the world's biggest consumer groups are making halal face creams and shampoos for Indonesia ahead of a new labeling law, part of a broader push to cater to growing Muslim populations as sales in many Western markets slow.</strongUnilever, Beiersdorf and L'Oreal are among the multinationals converting their supply chains for the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation.The law, the first of its kind, requires food to be labeled halal or not in 2017, followed by toiletries in 2018 and medicines in 2019.The companies say demand for beauty products that are halal, or target specific issues like veiled hair, will grow as the Muslim middle class grows. They note that Indonesia could influence other countries such as Malaysia where halal products made locally or by small, niche companies are also popular.Halal certification is official recognition that a product was manufactured in keeping with Islamic Sharia law. This means it must not contain traces of pork, alcohol or blood, and must be made on factory lines free of contamination risk, including from cleaning.Makers of cosmetics and toiletries say the burden is more administrative than financial, and therefore see compliance as unlocking new revenue streams.\"It's an enabler to do business in certain areas of the world,\" said Dirk Mampe of German chemicals company BASF, which sells ingredients to toiletries manufacturers and now has 145 of them certified halal. The halal ingredients do not carry premium price tags, he said.\"There is a trend that these halal products are being requested more and more, and the importance of being able to supply them is increasing.\"More than 1.5 billion people around the world are Muslim, accounting for about a quarter of the global population.Halal cosmetics were estimated to make up 11 percent of a global halal market worth more than $1 trillion in 2015, according to Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. Market research firm TechNavio sees halal personal care products' sales growing 14 percent per year until 2019, outpacing the broader market.strong>NOT-SO-SECRET FORMULA</strongFrench cosmetics giant L'Oreal already has a halal-certified factory in Indonesia that supplies the domestic market and its Southeast Asian neighbors. Most products under its Garnier brand, from face washes to skin lightening creams, are halal-certified, a spokeswoman said.The personal care industry already depends largely on plant-derived ingredients, so the rules for halal often affect production more than formulation.But certification can get complicated. For example, the maker of an Indonesian skin cream with a dozen ingredients from around the world would need to give Indonesian authorities proof from other certification bodies that each ingredient was made in a halal way.Malaysia-based DagangHalal has made a business from that complexity by establishing an online database of halal certificates to ease their exchange and expedite the process for applicants. As of February, it said 38 out of over 120 certification bodies worldwide had signed up.The company, which also runs a halal e-commerce site, reported 2015 revenue of 5.6 million Malaysian ringgit ($1.4 million), up 64 percent year-on-year. It raised 3.6 million pounds ($4.7 million) from this year's London stock listing, and is betting that halal cosmetics will gain traction beyond their current strongholds of Indonesia and Malaysia.\"Halal certification is a requirement that might be put in place by other countries in the future,\" Joerg Karas, general manager of Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics, said in a statement last month. The German company, which is ready to offer halal-certified products to customers such as L'Oreal and Procter &amp; Gamble, said it is \"well-equipped for this niche market\".Non-halal products will remain available in Indonesia following the labeling law, but may meet a backlash.\"The average Muslim consumer in Indonesia is not going to buy something that effectively says prohibited on it,\" said Abdalhamid Evans of halal consultancy firm Imarat Consultants.Unilever, which owns five of Indonesia's top ten beauty and personal care brands, says all nine of its factories there already meet halal standards and that it is currently working with third-party suppliers of imported ingredients.Alan Jope, who runs Unilever's personal care business from Singapore, told Reuters the cost of certification was \"not material\".strong>MUSLIM VALUES</strongCompetition with homegrown rivals steeped in local tradition can be fierce, especially when it comes to regulation. But Jope said the key for multinationals like Unilever -- with global marketing and development teams -- is understanding Muslim values generally and how they influence habits in specific markets with different cultures and ethnicities.\"Some (values) are common across Muslim countries,\" he said, noting that about 90 percent of Muslim consumers say faith influences their brand choices.\"But there's quite substantial differences between how a Muslim woman in Indonesia and a Muslim woman in Saudi Arabia express their faith and how that impacts their beauty regimes.\"He guessed that one third of the top twenty markets for Unilever's 20 billion euros-per-year business were countries with large Muslim populations, from India to Nigeria. He said better meeting their needs was a top strategic priority.To that end, Unilever has introduced products such as a gel body moisturizer that absorbs quickly beneath long undergarments and a long-lasting toothpaste appealing to those fasting for Ramadan.Like rival Henkel, it sells a line of shampoo for veiled hair, but Jope said the industry needs to improve its advertising, such as by featuring more women in hijabs.\"We need to be doing a better job reflecting Muslim values in our brand communication,\" he said.($1 = 4.0480 ringgit)($1 = 0.7614 pounds)", "label": 0}, "external-9": {"text": "strong>NEW YORK/LONDON: Global capital markets reeled on Friday after Britain voted to leave the European Union, with $2 trillion in value wiped from equity bourses worldwide, while money poured into safe-haven gold and government bonds. Sterling suffered a record plunge.</strongThe blow to investor confidence and the uncertainty the vote has sparked could keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates as planned this year, and even spark a new round of emergency policy easing from major central banks.The traditional safe-harbor assets of top-rated government debt, the Japanese yen and gold all jumped. Spot gold rose more than 5 percent and the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to lows last seen in 2012 at 1.5445 percent.Stocks tumbled in Europe. London's FTSE dropped 2.4 percent while Frankfurt and Paris each fell 6 percent to 8 percent. Italian and Spanish markets, and European bank stocks overall, were headed for their sharpest one-day drops ever.Worries that other EU states could hold their own referendums were compounded by the fact that markets had rallied on Thursday, seemingly convinced the UK would vote to stay in.Britain's big banks took a $100 billion battering, with Lloyds, Barclays and RBS plunging as much as 30 percent.Stocks on Wall Street opened more than 2 percent lower but cut losses after about an hour of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 340.24 points, or 1.89 percent, at 17,670.83, the S&amp;P 500 lost 42.11 points, or 1.99 percent, at 2,071.21 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 116.74 points, or 2.38 percent, at 4,793.31.MSCI's all-country world stock index fell 3.5 percent.Having campaigned to keep the country in the EU, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced he would step down.Results showed a 51.9/48.1 percent split for leaving, setting the UK on an uncertain path and dealing the largest setback to European efforts to forge greater unity since World War Two.More angst came as Scotland's first minister said the option of another vote for her country to split from the UK - rejected by Scottish voters two years ago - was now firmly on the table.The British pound dived by 18 U.S. cents at one point, easily the biggest fall in living memory, to its lowest since 1985. The euro, in turn, slid 3 percent to $1.1050 as investors feared for its very future.Sterling was last down 7.8 percent at $1.3719, having carved out a range of $1.3228 to $1.5022. The fall was even larger than during the global financial crisis and the currency was moving two or three cents in the blink of an eye.\"It's an extraordinary move for financial markets and also for democracy,\" said co-head of portfolio investments of London-based currency specialist Millennium Global Richard Benson.\"The market is pricing interest rate cuts from the big central banks and we assume there will be a global liquidity add from them,\" he added.That message was being broadcast loud and clear. The Bank of England, European Central Bank and the People's Bank of China all said they were ready to provide liquidity if needed to ensure global market stability.strong>SHOCKWAVES</strongThe shockwaves affected all asset classes and regions.The safe-haven yen jumped 3.6 percent to 102.29 per dollar, having been as low as 106.81. The dollar's peak decline of 4 percent was the largest since 1998.That prompted warnings from Japanese officials that excessive forex moves were undesirable. Traders said they were wary of being caught with exposed positions if the global central banks chose to step in to calm the volatility.Emerging market currencies across Asia and eastern Europe and South Africa's rand all buckled on fears that investors could pull out. Poland saw its zloty slump 4 percent.Europe's natural safety play, the 10-year German government bond, surged to send its yields tumbling back into negative territory and a new record low.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid almost 5 percent, Tokyo's Nikkei saw its worst fall since 2011, down 7.9 percent.Financial markets have been gripped for months by worries about what a British exit from the EU would mean for Europe's stability.\"Obviously, there will be a large spill-over effects across all global economies ... Not only will the UK go into recession, Europe will follow suit,\" predicted Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at fund manager Perpetual in Sydney.strong>BOND RALLY</strongInvestors stampeded into low-risk sovereign bonds, with U.S. 10-year notes gained two full points in price to yield 1.521 percent. Earlier, the yield dipped to 1.406 percent, only slightly higher than a record low 1.38 percent reached in July 2012.\u0093Right now it\u0092s 'every man for himself' safety buying,\" said Tom Tucci, head of Treasuries trading at CIBC in New York.The rally even extended to UK bonds, despite a warning from ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's that it was likely to downgrade Britain's triple-A credit rating if it left the EU. Yields on benchmark 10-year gilts fell 27 basis points to 1.0092 pct.Across the Atlantic, investors were pricing in less chance of another hike in U.S. interest rates given the Federal Reserve had cited a British exit from the EU as one reason to be cautious on tightening.\"A July (hike) is definitely off the table,\" said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon.Fed funds futures were even toying with the chance that the next move could be a cut in U.S. rates.Oil prices slumped by more than 4 percent amid fears of a broader economic slowdown that could reduce demand. U.S. crude shed $2.12 to $47.99 a barrel while Brent fell as much as 6 percent to $47.83 before clawing back to $48.60.Industrial metal copper sank 3 percent but gold galloped more than 6 percent higher thanks to its perceived safe haven status.", "label": 0}, "external-10": {"text": "strong>BRASILIA: Brazil arrested 10 people on Thursday suspected of belonging to a poorly organised group supporting Islamic State (IS) and discussing terrorist acts during the next month's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</strongThe group, described as \"absolutely amateur\" by Justice Minister Alexandre Moraes, were all Brazilian citizens and in contact via messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram. They did not know each other personally, the minister said.The arrests came a week after a truck massacre in Nice, France, and amid growing fears of a possible attack when the first Olympics to be held in South America kicks off on Aug. 5. Some 500,000 visitors are expected to travel to Brazil for the Games, many of them from the United States.Although Brazil has no history of conflict with known militant groups, Moraes said the Games had made the Latin American country a more likely target, particularly because of participation by countries fighting IS.\"Today was the first operation against a supposed terrorist cell in Brazil,\" he told a news conference. \"Brazil was not part of the coalition against IS but, because of the upcoming Olympics and because it will receive many foreigners, Brazil has become a target.\"Moraes said the individuals detained on Thursday were being monitored because they had accessed websites linked to IS, but the group had \"no preparation at all\" and was a \"disorganized cell\". He said that authorities intervened when the group started planning actions including martial-arts training and the purchase of firearms.While the group did not have direct contact with IS, some members had made \"pro forma\" declarations of allegiance to the militant Islamist group via social media, the minister said.A presidential aide said on Thursday that Brazilian police and intelligence services had cooperated with French, German, British, Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies in the arrests.Brazil's federal police are monitoring around 100 people for possible links to terrorist groups, mostly in the lawless tri-border region with Paraguay and Argentina, said the aide, requesting anonymity.\"Brazil was really being preemptive in this case,\" said Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical analysis at Stratfor, a global intelligence and advisory firm. \"There are some tactical benefits to arrests like this...You could disrupt anything in the works and it may also give other people pause.\"strong>OPERATION HASHTAG</strongBrazil plans to deploy about 85,000 soldiers, police and other security personnel during the Rio Games, more than twice as many in place for the London Olympics in 2012.It will also operate a joint security centre where representatives from more than 100 countries are expected to help share intelligence and monitor the event.Local media raised concern that the arrests might affect ticket sales for the Games, with the release of 100,000 tickets on Thursday aimed at improving attendance.The local Olympic organising committee, Rio 2016, referred requests for comment to the federal government.Moraes said there was no evidence that the group had acquired weapons though one member had contacted a clandestine weapons site in neighbouring Paraguay that sells AK-47 assault rifles.\"Those involved participated in an online group denominated 'the defenders of Sharia' and were planning to acquire weapons to commit crimes in Brazil and even overseas,\" Moraes said.Two people will be brought in for questioning, including the head of a local NGO, in addition to the 10 people arrested across as many states, Moraes added.Federal Judge Marcos Josegrei da Silva, who approved the arrests from the southern city of Curitiba, said police had 30 days to analyse evidence. He emphasized that no-one had been charged in the operation, codenamed Hashtag.\"These are internet affirmations on social networks,\" Josegrei told a news conference. \"Not everything a person conceives of in the virtual world is carried out in the real world.\"Interim President Michel Temer called an emergency cabinet meeting following the arrests, the first under Brazil's tough new anti-terrorism law approved this year.Brazilian and U.S. officials have raised concern over the disappearance of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Jihad Diyab, after he had resettled in neighbouring Uruguay, saying he could now be in Brazil.Last week, Brazil deported a French-Algerian nuclear physicist convicted by a Paris court in 2012 for his involvement in helping to plot an attack in France in 2009 with an al Qaeda militant in Algeria.Brazil's intelligence agency said on Tuesday it was investigating all threats to the Rio Olympics, after a previously unknown Brazilian Islamist group calling itself \"Ansar al-Khilafah Brazil\" pledged allegiance to IS. It was unclear whether those detained on Thursday have any relation with that group.On Wednesday, SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. company that monitors the internet, said alleged Islamist militants were giving advice for lone actors to carry out attacks during the Games, including the use of toy drones. The messages are being sent via the mobile messaging system Telegram, SITE said.Stratfor's Stewart said that, with no ability to project terrorist operatives into Brazil, IS could only seek to encourage grassroots groups. Brazil has one of the world's largest Arab diasporas, mostly Christians of Syrian and Lebanese origins.After last week's attack in Nice, France, Brazilian authorities said they would step up security measures for the Games by adding further roadblocks and cordons and frisking more visitors in Rio de Janeiro.

Monday promised \"the toughest sanctions available\" after a report found Moscow had concealed hundreds of positive doping tests in many sports ahead of the Sochi winter Games.</strongThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) did not spell out whether it would heed growing calls for Olympic bans already imposed on Russia's track and field athletes and weightlifters to be extended to all its competitors in Rio.However, IOC President Thomas Bach said the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) investigation had revealed \"a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport and on the Olympic Games.The IOC Executive Board is to hold a telephone conference on Tuesday to take its first decisions, which may include provisional measures and sanctions with regard to the Rio Olympics.\"Therefore, the IOC will not hesitate to take the toughest sanctions available against any individual or organisation implicated.\"WADA itself explicitly urged the IOC to consider banning Russia from the Rio Olympics altogether.Russian President Vladimir Putin, who staked his reputation on the Sochi Games, the costliest in history, said the WADA-backed report was the result of political interference and that the Olympic movement could now split.The report confirmed allegations made by Grigory Rodchenkov, former head of the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory.He told the New York Times two months ago that dozens of Russians had used performance-enhancing drugs in Sochi with the support not only of national sports authorities but even the domestic intelligence service, the FSB.Monday's report said Russia, a traditional sporting superpower, had been stung into action by its performance at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, where it finished 11th, with only three gold medals.\"The surprise result of the Sochi investigation was the revelation of the extent of State oversight and directed control of the Moscow Laboratory in processing and covering up urine samples of Russian athletes from virtually all sports before and after the Sochi Games,\" said the report, unveiled in Toronto.strong>\"FAILSAFE STRATEGY\"</strongThe investigation was led by Canadian sports lawyer Richard McLaren, who sat on the independent commission that last year exposed doping and corruption in Russian track and field, leading to its exclusion from international competition.The report said Deputy Sports Minister Yuri Nagornykh had been advised of every positive test across all sports from 2011 onwards and decided \"who would benefit from a cover up and who would not be protected.\"The State implemented a simple failsafe strategy,\" it said. \"If all the operational precautions to promote and permit doping by Russian athletes proved to have been ineffective for whatever reason, the laboratory provided a failsafe mechanism.\"The State had the ability to transform a positive analytical result into a negative one by ordering that the analytical process of the Moscow Laboratory be altered.\"Among the hundreds of samples that disappeared were 35 from Paralympic athletes.In Sochi itself, where international observers were scrutinizing the drug tests, positive results could not simply be brushed away, so the FSB developed a method of opening urine bottles to allow samples to be swapped undetected.Rodchenkov spoke of a clandestine night-time operation in which staff secretly took samples from the lab via a \"mouse hole\" cut into a wall, and replaced them with clean samples taken from the same athlete months earlier and sometimes manipulated.strong>\"CREDIBLE WITNESSES\"</strongMcLaren said Rodchenkov and all other witnesses interviewed had been deemed credible, and the report said the investigators \"confirm the general veracity of the published information concerning the sample swapping that went on at the Sochi Laboratory during the Sochi Games\".The investigations showed that caps had been removed from a number of samples, and that they contained unusually high levels of salt, \"significantly exceeding the levels produced by the human body\".Nagornykh and Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, who was mentioned 21 times in McLaren's 97-page report, were not immediately available for comment.Putin said in a statement that there was \"no place for doping in sport\", and that the officials named in the report would be suspended.Following the statement, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev suspended Deputy Sports Minister Nagornykh.Putin also said the allegations were based on the testimony of only one man, and were an attempt to \"make sport an instrument of geopolitical pressure, to form a negative image of countries and peoples\".Harking back to the tit-for-tat superpower boycotts of the 1980s, he said: \"The Olympic movement ... may again be on the verge of a split.\"In a leaked draft letter intended to be sent to the IOC on Monday, U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) CEO Travis Tygart called for a ban on all Russian athletes, not only in track and field.Paul Melia, head of the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sports, said the letter was backed by various athletes' committees and the anti-doping organisations of the United States, Germany, Japan and New Zealand, among others.However, Russian track and field athletes have appealed against their ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is due to rule by Thursday.If it finds in their favour, there would seem to be little chance of a wider ban on Russian competitors holding up.Bach had indicated last week that he was reluctant to see athletes from one sport punished for the crimes of athletes or officials from another.", "label": 0}, "external-12": {"text": "strong>BEIJING: China's massive export engine sputtered for the second

Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20.China's trade surplus with the United States was $366 billion in 2015, according to U.S. customs data, which Trump could seize on in a bid to bring Beijing to the negotiating table to press for concessions, economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a recent research note.A sustained trade surplus of more than $20 billion against the United States is one of three criteria used by the U.S. Treasury to designate another country as a currency manipulator.China is likely to point out that its own data showed the surplus fell to $250.79 billion in 2016 from $260.91 billion in 2015, but that may get short shrift in Washington.\"Our worry is that Trump\u0092s stance towards China\u0092s trade could bring about long-term structural weakness in China\u0092s exports,\" economists at ANZ said in a note.\"Trump\u0092s trade policy will likely motivate U.S. businesses to move their manufacturing facilities away from China, although the latter\u0092s efforts in promoting high-end manufacturing may offset part of the loss.\"On Wednesday, China may have set off a warning shot to the Trump administration. Beijing announced even higher anti-dumping duties on imports of certain animal feed from the United States than it proposed last year.\"Instead of caving in and trying to prepare voluntary export restraints like Japan did with their auto exports back in the 1980s, we believe China would start by strongly protesting against the labeling with the IMF, but not to initiate more aggressive retaliation ... immediately,\" the BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report said.\"That said, even a 'war of words' could weaken investor confidence not only in the U.S. and China, but globally.\"CHINA'S DECEMBER EXPORTS FALLChina's December exports fell by a more-than-expected 6.1 percent on-year, while imports beat forecasts slightly, growing 3.1 percent on its strong demand for commodities which has helped buoy global resources prices.An unexpected 0.1 percent rise in shipments in November, while scant, had raised hopes that China was catching up to an export improvement being seen in some other Asian economies.China reported a trade surplus of $40.82 billion for December, versus November's $44.61 billion.While the export picture has been grim all year, with shipments rising in only two months out of 12, import trends have been more encouraging of late, pointing to a pick-up in domestic demand as companies brought in more raw materials from iron ore to copper to help feed a construction boom.China imported record amounts of crude oil, iron ore, copper and soybeans in 2016, plus large volumes of coal used for heating and in steelmaking.\"Trade protectionism is on the rise but China is relying more on domestic demand,\" said Wen Bin, an economist at Minsheng Bank in Beijing.Prolonged weakness in exports has forced China's government to rely on higher spending and massive bank lending to boost the economy, at the risk of adding to a huge pile of debt which some analysts warn is nearing danger levels.Data next Friday is expected to almost certainly show that 2016 economic growth hit Beijing's target of 6.5-7 percent thanks to that flurry of stimulus.But signs are mounting that the red-hot property market may have peaked, meaning China may have less appetite this year for imports of building-related materials.\"It is hard to see what could drive a more substantial recovery in Chinese trade,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.\"Further upside to economic activity, both in China and abroad, is probably now limited given declines in trend growth. Instead, the risks to trade lie to the downside...,\" he said, saying the chance of a damaging China-U.S. trade spat has risen since Trump's appointment of hardliners to lead trade policy.A decline in China's trade surplus in 2016, to just under $510 billion from $594 billion in 2015, may also reduce authorities' ability to offset capital outflow pressures, which have helped drive its yuan currency to more than eight-year lows, ANZ economists said.", "label": 0}, "external-13": {"text": "Manchester United sacked manager Louis van Gaal on Monday after an FA Cup triumph failed to make up for the club's inability to qualify for the Champions League amid widespread discontent with a season of insipid performances.The Dutchman was dismissed two days after United's win over Crystal Palace in the Wembley Cup final, their first trophy in three years, paving the way for the widely-expected appointment of former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho as his successor.News of Van Gaal's impending departure from the club leaked out minutes after Saturday's 2-1 extra-time victory over Palace and, following relentless media speculation and a day of negotiations, it was confirmed by both sides on Monday evening.\"I'd like to thank Louis and his staff for their excellent work in the past two years culminating in winning a record-equalling 12th FA Cup for the club,\" executive vice chairman Ed Woodward said in a statement on the website of the club owned by the American Glazer family (www.manutd.com).\"He has behaved with great professionalism and dignity throughout his time here. He leaves us with a legacy of having given several young players the confidence to show their ability on the highest stage.\"Van Gaal, though gushing in his appreciation of the chance to manage the club, was not so happy to be moving on.\"I am very disappointed to be unable to complete our intended three-year plan,\" he said.\"It has been an honour to manage such a magnificent club as Manchester United FC, and in doing so, I have fulfilled a long-held ambition.\"I have been privileged during my management career to have won 20 trophies but winning the FA Cup, which is steeped in so much history, will always be one of the most special achievements of my career.\"That success, however, could not gloss over a season in which United finished fifth in the standings, missing out on Champions League qualification, and where dull performances had the fans booing their own team even after victories.\u00a0<strong>DISGRUNTLED FANS</strongAfter replacing David Moyes two years ago, Van Gaal got the team into the Champions League in his first season.However, United's inability to produce the free-flowing football that characterised Alex Ferguson's trophy-laden reign eventually caused a rift throughout the club and in the stands.For generations of fans brought up to expect high octane attacking football, Van Gaal's stultifying approach was hard to swallow, particularly when it did not work well, after he spent almost 300 million pounds ($434.34 million) on players.This season's dire statistics, beyond the key one of fifth place, are a damning indictment of the Dutchman's tactics.United scored 49 goals in 38 games, in contrast to their previous Premier League average of over 76 and fourth-placed Manchester City's 71.They had the joint-highest number of goalless draws in the division, while Opta noted that United's 430 shots on target was 15th in the 20-team league and they made more backward passes than any other side.It was not just supporters who were disgruntled either.A story in Monday's Guardian newspaper said squad members had talked among themselves about openly defying the Dutchman's rigid tactical directions, which allegedly included instructions to players not to take first-time shots.It also reported that the two most senior players, Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick, had raised concerns with Van Gaal about his post-match \"evaluation sessions\" in which he publicly criticised players in front of their team mates\u00a0<strong>WIDESPREAD DISSATISFACTION</strongWith such widespread dissatisfaction it easy to forget that the 64-year-old former Ajax Amsterdam, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Netherlands coach was seen as the safe option when he was hired by United in May 2014 following Moyes's sacking.He got the club back in the Champions League with a fourth-place finish but, despite heavy spending on the likes of Memphis Depay, Anthony Martial and Bastian Schweinsteiger, United stagnated after topping the table at the end of September.French striker Martial apart, the new players struggled to justify their fees, and Van Gaal increasingly turned to talented youngsters such as Marcus Rashford, who has rapidly emerged from United's youth team to earn a place in the England squad.By mid-December United were out of the top four after successive defeats by promoted clubs Bournemouth and Norwich City and they exited the Champions League after finishing third in a modest group behind VfL Wolfsburg and PSV Eindhoven.At home to Southampton United were booed off the pitch and in Denmark the supporters, already frustrated by finding their team playing in the Europa League, chanted obscenities about how bad Van Gaal's side were in a 2-1 loss to FC Midjytlland.Despite recovering with a 5-1 win in the second leg, United then lost to Liverpool in the round of 16.A late challenge for fourth place, the Cup run and the fan-pleasing introduction of the youngsters, bought Van Gaal time but in the bigger picture it was not enough to change the mood.Hovering in the background since his sacking in December has been Mourinho, once the scourge of Old Trafford for Porto and Chelsea but now seemingly about to be welcomed with open arms.The Portuguese is hardly a graduate of the swashbuckling school of football himself but his remarkable record of success across Europe, combined with a larger-than-life personality, mean that, if he is appointed, United fans will at least be able to look forward to next season rather than dreading it.", "label": 0}, "external-14": {"text": "strong>SEOUL: At an

Analysts say this could dent sales by smaller firms, but note that bigger companies already limit duty-free purchases to control store inventory.\"New ingredients, new packaging, new formulas come on the market continuously, and when something does well Korean brands respond quickly,\" said Jang Jun-kee, managing director of the Korea Cosmetics Foundation, an industry group.Amorepacific's 2008 hit product, the cushion compact - a multifunctional sponge applicator for anything from liquid facial cover and sun protection to make-up base and moisturiser - inspired follow-up products from global brands such as L'Oreal's (OREP.PA) Lancome and Estee Lauder's (EL.N) Clinique.Innovative, often cute, packaging also helps.The Face Shop, a mass brand from South Korea's second-ranked cosmetics firm LG Household &amp; Health Care (051900.KS), said last month it sold out of its initial 130,000 cushion compacts featuring Disney characters - costing 20,000 won ($17.82) - in just two days. It said it expects to launch about 600 new products this year.Beyond popularising beauty trends such as facial cosmetic products \"BB cream\" and \"CC cream\", South Korea has a reputation for innovation and for using natural and Oriental medicine ingredients from flowers and tea leaves to donkey milk, snail and seahorse to differentiate its so-called K-beauty products.\"Korean consumers are very sophisticated.

If Saturday's big match involved goalposts and a large, inflated ball, India would lose no sleep over it.It is, instead, a cricket match. And not just any cricket match. It is the cricket match that causes a spike in the frequency of Venkatesh Prasad sightings on Indian television in the days leading up to it. And of Aamer Sohail and Kiran More and Javed Miandad and Ajay Jadeja and Waqar Younis and Joginder Sharma and Misbah-ul-Haq.It is an India-Pakistan clash at a World tournament, and it will come with the inevitable trappings.

And Wasim Akram. And Kapil Dev. And Inzamam-ul-Haq.In the middle of all this, India and Pakistan, the cricket teams, will try and tune out the constant swirl of India-Pakistan.R Ashwin reinforced this during his pre-match conference on Friday, in a packed and insufficiently air-conditioned media room that evoked the pressure cooker clich\u00e9.\"This rivalry is huge,\" he said. \"It's very hard to put a finger [on it] and say how huge it is. It's probably bigger than the Ashes is. As far as the Indians go and the Pakistanis go, I don't think they watch this as a game of cricket. It's more of a border rivalry, they want to get one up on each other.\"So there is much more to this game rather than the game itself taking centrestage. As far as people are concerned, they put their emotions into it. For the players it's about trying to keep the emotions aside and playing the game the best we can.\"It is something India have invariably managed to do against Pakistan at World events. In six World Cup meetings and four in the World T20, they have never lost. It's the sort of record that can put pressure on both sides, but on this occasion India are under more of it, given that they are playing at home, and given that they were beaten soundly by New Zealand in their first game and therefore have to win this one. Over recent years, Pakistan have usually been underdogs going into matches against India, and on this occasion have the cushion of a big win in their opening game against Bangladesh.\"History can change, too,\" Waqar Younis, Pakistan's head coach, said. \"We are confident, a little more this time because [India] can go out of the tournament also. They will be under a lot of pressure. We have to take it positively. We have won the last match, so there are lots of things going in our favour, hopefully. Yes, there is no doubt that our history hasn't been so good but history can always be changed.\"In all the previous games, the pressure was on Pakistani team. This is the first time that the pressure is more on India - not arising from victory or defeat at the hands of Pakistan but because this is a very big tournament. I have been a cricketer all my years and it is impossible that India won't be feeling the pressure. I am sure they will be feeling the pressure and we are going to take advantage of that.\"India arrived in Kolkata on Wednesday night, but only had an optional training session - which only Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane and Pawan Negi attended - on Thursday. Their first full session ahead of the match was on its eve. Ashwin said the light schedule was followed to allow the players to relax after the loss to New Zealand, and not put themselves under too much pressure.\"I think it was more about trying and relaxing,\" he said. \"It had nothing to do with who we are playing, what game we are playing and all that. We have been on the road for the last three months and we thought it's time now to sit in the hotel room and revisit what we did in the last game. The best thing that we can do is to think for ourselves than sitting together and practising.\"What happens after a game like that is we tend to go into nervous practice, try and overdo everything, and eventually end up going into the match a little more tired than we actually should be. That's the idea behind it.\"India's practice session on Friday reflected this mindset, with the bowlers hardly taxing themselves and only the middle-order trio of Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni and Hardik Pandya spending any real length of time batting. Pakistan - after their unconvincing footballing warm-up - had a more traditional nets session, with the fast bowlers coming off their full run-ups and sending down a relatively large quota of deliveries.Two training philosophies, neither definitely better or worse than the other, both geared to the same end: to keep minds focused on bat and ball, to tune out the crowds and the last-minute venue changes and the razzmatazz of the build-up. As Virat Kohli said before the start of the tournament, \"On the field is the safest and quietest place for you\".

It goes on to explain why Morgan Stanley expects demographic-led shifts in savings and investment to soon push interest rates higher and transform that debt mountain into additional deadweight on world growth over next five years.But the role of the U.S. dollar as the world's main reserve currency denominating large chunks of that debt pile is showing up as complicating factor that's added to risk of instability.The first U.S. interest rate increase in almost a decade in December - just a quarter of a percentage point - was enough to trigger a convulsion in world markets that led to the worst start to a year for global stocks since World War Two.Underlining 'cause and effect', the subsequent recovery only came about once the Federal Reserve hastily made clear it was pressing the pause button precisely because of seismic events in world finance.Few doubt a growing U.S. economy that's near full employment can absorb some normalization of interest rates from near zero, and a higher dollar goes hand in hand with that.But the rest of the world clearly can't.The Bank for International Settlements estimates that while U.S. dollar dominance means it accounts for almost 90 percent of all foreign exchange transactions and some 60 percent of hard currency reserves. But crucially it also accounts for about 60 percent of all debts and assets outside the United States.And if the rest of the world goes into shock because of the higher cost of servicing and paying back those dollar debts, the boomerang effect on U.S. exporters, commodity firms and the wider economy just ends up tying the Fed's hands in ways made crystal clear this year already.strong>AMBIVALENCE</strongNo surprise, then, the U.S. central bank has no deep love for the dollar's prime reserve currency status - even though it's been described by Europeans and others over the years as an \"exorbitant privilege\" that ensures the world lends to the U.S. Treasury in its own currency at low interest rates regardless of dollar strength.Speaking at an event in Zurich on Tuesday on the dollar's global status, New York Fed chief Bill Dudley said Americans should not be perturbed if other currencies such as the euro or China's yuan eventually eat into the dollar's share of reserves.\"If other countries' currencies emerge to gain stature as reserve currencies, it is not obvious to me that the United States loses,\" he said, as long as it \"is being driven by their progress, rather than by the U.S. doing a poorer job.\"While that's far from wishing away dollar hegemony, it speaks to the greater ambivalence among central bankers toward reserve status than their national treasury chiefs - given how widespread use of the currency can compromise domestic policy.It's that tension that risks sowing instability everywhere.If the Fed can't adjust monetary policy because of fears of transmitting a self-defeating shockwave around the world via the dollar, then there's understandable concern that artificially low Fed policy just stores up even more debt and international accounting imbalances and undermines the very currency that's supposed to play anchor.At the same event in Zurich, Claudio Borio, head of the monetary and economic Department of the BIS, said the dollar's role could potentially exacerbate instability by allowing the United States to run larger and more persistent fiscal and current account deficits - and to run looser monetary policy for longer.What's more, a resulting Fed easing bias spreads to developed and emerging economies as governments resist a weaker dollar for competitiveness or financial stability reasons, Borio added.\"Easing begets easing,\" he said.For Morgan Stanley, this is just leads to ever-higher debt, and there are no painless ways out of a problem that will start to hurt significantly over the coming years - only a series of \"less painful\" options including the option of consolidating debts and making them permanent or perpetual.In the meantime, the U.S. bank said, the dollar itself will most likely push higher again, if only because the U.S. economy is probably the only one that can absorb a rising exchange rate in this environment.For Borio, a more 'pluralistic' system with many world currencies sharing the reserve role doesn't by itself solve any problem, either. There would then be no credible single anchor.Hard-headed cooperation and joint decision making may be the only answer.\"This means not just putting one's house in order, but also putting our global village in order.\"", "label": 0}, "external-22": {"text": "strong>WASHINGTON: Hillary Clinton began her presidential campaign by promising to do what it takes to rein in Wall Street.</strongBoosted by Wall Street's toughest critics, U.S. senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate has declared \"the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top\" and said she would raise bank fees and tighten banking regulations. She has encouraged regulators to break up too-risky banks.And yet, Wall Street appears unperturbed by the prospect of a Clinton presidency. In fact, the banking industry has supported Clinton with buckets of cash and stocks have sold off on days when the Clinton campaign stumbles. Privately, bankers say that they trust her to remain a pragmatist who will keep the current regulatory regime laid down by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed in 2010.\u0093I don\u0092t think Clinton wakes up thinking about Wall Street,\" one senior banking industry lobbyist said.There are hints in apparently leaked email discussions among Clinton's campaign staff that bankers are not far off the mark when they count on her to tread lightly.Pressed during the campaign by progressive Democrats to call for a revival of the Glass-Steagall Act that would require separation of commercial and investment banking, Clinton ultimately refused. She also weighed another progressive favorite - a tax on financial transactions- but instead recommended a far narrower plan to tax only canceled orders by high speed traders.Ultimately, what bankers most like about Clinton is that she is not Donald Trump.Many financiers fear her unorthodox Republican rival could disrupt global trade, damage geopolitical relationships and rattle markets, industry analysts and participants say.\u0093Those are the kind of things that corner offices think about,\u0094 said Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics Inc, whose firm advises financial firms about U.S. regulatory policy. \u0093The overriding concern about Trump has dominated people\u0092s thinking.\"Trump's candidacy has upended traditional political alliances and bankers that usually contribute more to the Republicans have been flinging money at Clinton.Employees of the 17 largest bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have been sending her $10 for every $1 they contributed to Trump, according to a Reuters analysis. In 2012, the same group contributed twice as much to Republican candidate Mitt Romney as it did to President Barack Obama's re-election campaign.strong>DEVIL YOU KNOW</strongPeople who work for hedge funds and private equity firms have contributed more than $56 million to Clinton\u0092s presidential campaign and the supporting groups that face no legal cap on donations. Trump\u0092s campaign and related groups received just $243,000 from donors in the same sector, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.\u0093It\u0092s basically going with the devil you know over the devil you don\u0092t,\u0094 said Brian Gardner, a managing director of New York investment firm Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. What also helped, he said, was the familiarity with Hillary and Bill Clinton dating back to the 1990s when her husband was president and ushered in a period of financial deregulation.\u0093There is a closeness and a comfort level between the titans on Wall Street and the Clintons,\" he said.For bankers, the biggest worry is a scenario where Clinton wins and the Democrats take control of the House and the Senate, with progressives such as Warren and Sanders holding sway over everything from new tax laws to appointments of regulators.Already, Warren has called for immediate dismissal of the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White. Last year, Warren successfully led a movement to derail Obama\u0092s plan to appoint banker Antonio Weiss to the top job at Treasury.Warren and other progressives will press Clinton to be tough on Wall Street in return for their campaign support.Clinton \"leaned heavily on Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and progressive ideas, when she needed to excite voters,\u0094 Adam Green with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee said. \u0093Elizabeth Warren has proven she\u0092s a very powerful ally to have on your side. And it\u0092s well known she\u0092s also a formidable opponent to have against you,\u0094 Green said.However, recent polls suggest it is unlikely that Democrats will take the House and the future of the Senate is far from certain. Even if the Senate goes Democratic, it is likely to be led by New York Senator Chuck Schumer, a moderate who has represented Wall Street with the industry's backing.Clinton has said she will propose a \"risk fee\" on the largest financial firms and tighten up rules which allow banks to circumvent bans on proprietary trading by investing in hedge funds. Like Trump, she has proposed to end the tax break that private equity investors enjoy, termed \"carried interest.\"Yet such provisions will be probably tied up in a much larger tax initiative that will involve months, if not a year or more, of horse trading in Washington. Ultimately, it could end up overshadowed by other progressive goals, such as infrastructure funding, college affordability, or raising the minimum wage.Those are the causes that Clinton has prioritized and they are likely to supersede her anti-bank rhetoric, say bankers.

Co.Beijing has also criticized Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, for running surveillance flights over disputed islands in the South China Sea.Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said China must set up a mechanism to address its problem of industrial overcapacity, saying it was \"unacceptable\" the European steel industry had lost so many jobs in recent years.\"Overcapacity is a global problem but there is a particular Chinese element,\" he told a news conference.Britain's future after its departure from the European Union was also subject to discussion.Obama reassured Prime Minister May that Britain's closest political, commercial and military ally would stand by her.But he did not shrink away from his stance that Brexit was a mistake and that London would not be able to jump the queue to arrange a bilateral trade deal.Juncker said that if Britain wanted access to the European Union's common market, it needed to respect the rules of the common market.Turnbull, meanwhile, said Australia wanted an early free trade agreement with Britain so markets could remain open between them when Britain formally left the European trading bloc.LATE NIGHT TALKSObama held talks with Xi on Saturday that ran late into the night.He urged Beijing to uphold its legal obligations in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, and stressed U.S. commitments to its regional allies.Xi said China would continue to safeguard its sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea.But China is keen to keep the summit focused on economic issues and to prevent other disputes from overshadowing it.According to a \"fact sheet\" on China-U.S. relations issued on Sunday, the two sides agreed on a range of issues, including avoiding competitive currency devaluations and not limiting deal opportunities for foreign information and communication technology providers.Obama, now in the last five months of his presidency, is using the visit to put a final stamp on his signature policy shift toward the Pacific, setting the tone for his White House successor, who will be elected in November and take office on Jan. 20.His visit began chaotically at the Hangzhou airport, where his staff argued with Chinese security over media access.

(for) international forces has led to abuse by fuel traders which allows them to illegally profit,\" said a new report by the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (MEC), which was seen by AFP.The report, due to be released on Tuesday, said 20 commercial companies were issued tax-exemption certificates last year.The process to obtain \"maafinamas\" involves a tightly bureaucratic application system that goes through the US military, NATO and the Afghan finance and foreign ministries -- but the document remains prone to \"misuse\".\"Companies that possess legitimate exemption forms have been known to sell the original to other companies,\" the report said, explaining how military fuel was ending up in the commercial market.\"(Also) after the customs department process the exemption paperwork, the companies that have been granted exemption forms re-sell the fuel.\"NATO said it could not immediately comment, and the interior and defence ministries did not respond to AFP\u00b4s queries.Shafiq Qarizada, deputy minister for customs, told AFP he \"cannot confirm nor deny\" whether exempted fuel is washing up in the commercial market.strong>- \u00b4Contaminated\u00b4 -</strongThe comments come ahead of a crucial conference in Brussels in October, where donor countries are expected to reaffirm civilian aid funding for Afghanistan over the next four years.Afghanistan is battling what observers label \"donor fatigue\" as efforts to replace its huge foreign aid dependency with self-sufficiency are thwarted by corruption and criminal networks imperilling the already weak economy.Misuse of fuel exemptions is killing local businesses in a country that is heavily dependent upon imports to meet its energy needs, two private traders told AFP.The exemption waves off 12 percent customs duty among other charges, officials say.\"Maafinamas have contaminated the commercial market,\" said the official who carried out the inspection.\"How can a trader who dutifully pays taxes compete with cheaper maafinama fuel? This is suffocating lawful businesses and encouraging smuggling of fuel... and resulting in custom revenue losses worth millions.\"The misuse also has potential military implications.In May last year 17 Afghan policemen were killed when the Taliban stormed their remote base in the mountainous province of Badakhshan.Officials at the time said the policemen were unable to escape because they lacked adequate fuel for their vehicles, raising concern that military fuel was not reaching its intended destination.There are ongoing discussions for a Memorandum of Understanding between NATO and the finance ministry to curb the misuse of maafinamas, multiple sources including Qarizada told AFP.Among various reforms being discussed is a suggestion to levy customs duty on all military fuel and reimburse payments for actual deliveries.\"MEC understands from interviews with both (NATO) and (finance ministry) that this reform is strongly supported but it is still not implemented,\" the MEC report said.\"Why not?

He turned pro soon after that.Early in his career, he battled societal norms as frequently as he did his opponents. In 1964, as the struggle for civil rights simmered, he knocked out heavy favorite Sonny Liston to win the heavyweight title for the first time, then told reporters that he was a member of the Nation of Islam and had changed his name to Muhammad Ali, a name many news outlets at the time were slow to recognize.By 1967, he had successfully defended the title nine times, all but two by knockout. With the Vietnam War raging, he refused induction into the U.S. Army, on religious grounds, and was arrested and charged with draft evasion. When prodded further for his reasons for resisting, he said, \u0093I am not going 10,000 miles to help murder, kill, and burn other people to simply help continue the domination of white slave-masters over dark people the world over.\u0094Though he remained free on appeal, he was stripped of his title and not allowed to box for more than three years. The conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court, unanimously, in 1971. (A 2013 film by Stephen Frears, \u0093Muhammad Ali\u0092s Greatest Fight,\u0094 which dramatized the court\u0092s decision, debuted in Cannes, aired on HBO in the U.S., and earned an Emmy nomination.)During his exile from the ring, Ali decided to try acting, starring in the 1969 Broadway musical \u0093Buck White\u0094 at the George Abbott Theatre. He played a militant black lecturer, and got better reviews than the show, which closed after seven performances. \u0093He sings with a pleasant slightly impersonal voice, acts without embarrassment and moves with innate dignity,\u0094 wrote New York Times reviewer Clive Barnes.Ali\u0092s boxing career was defined by his matches against top opponents, particularly rivals Joe Frazier and George Foreman. His 1971 bout with Frazier to unify the heavyweight championship, his third after being reinstated, was called the Fight of the Century. Among those in attendance at Madison Square Garden were Miles Davis, Barbra Streisand, and Sammy Davis Jr. Bert Lancaster was the color commentator for the closed-circuit TV feed. Life Magazine hired Frank Sinatra as the photographer for Norman Mailer\u0092s story.Ali had exploded the era of humble sports heroes when he declared, \u0093I am the greatest!\u0094 in the run-up to his title fight with Liston. He also was among the first athletes to trash-talk his opponents, and he called Frazier, who supported the war, an Uncle Tom. Frazier knocked down Ali in the 15th round, and won a unanimous decision.Ali had to wait three years for another shot at the championship, this time against Foreman, who had beaten Frazier so badly in taking the title that few gave the 32-year-old challenger a chance against the 25-year-old champ. Ali called the fight, held in Kinshasa, Zaire, the Rumble in the Jungle. In documenting the bout 22 years later, Gast\u0092s Oscar-winning \u0093When We Were Kings\u0094 showed how an ebullient Ali had arrived on the scene a few days before the taciturn Foreman, and won over the nation\u0092s citizens. An impromptu entourage of hundreds followed him around chanting, \u0093Ali, bomaye!\u0094 (Ali, kill him!).In 1977, Ali lent his name to a short-lived NBC animated series \u0093I Am the Greatest!: The Adventures of Muhammad Ali.\u0094 Somewhat more memorably that year, he joined Sylvester Stallone \u0097 whose \u0093Rocky\u0094 was to win best picture \u0097 to present the best supporting actress award to Beatrice Straight for her role in \u0093Network.\u0094In the ring, a third, brutal fight against Frazier (the \u0093Thrilla in Manilla\u0094) as well as battles with Ken Norton subjected Ali to a great deal of punishment.

They include term limits for top officials and disclosure of their earnings.Whoever takes over from Blatter, who ran FIFA for 17 years like a globe-trotting head of state, will inherit a very different job with the focus on crisis management, after dozens of international football officials were indicted in the United States last year for racketeering, money-laundering and bribery.Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa is the bookmaker's favourite with UEFA's Swiss general secretary Gianni Infantino a close second.Jordanian Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein believes he is still firmly in the race however, while Frenchman Jerome Champagne and South African Tokyo Sexwale will hope to make an impact.There was little indication on Thursday, though, that the vote would be anything other than a two-horse race between Sheikh Salman and Infantino.\"I am feeling good and very positive.

Iran has argued it should be exempt from such limits as its production recovers after the lifting of EU sanctions earlier this year.The Saudi and Iranian economies depend heavily on oil but in a post-sanctions environment, Iran is suffering less pressure from the halving in crude prices since 2014 and its economy could expand by almost 4 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Riyadh, on the other hand, faces a second year of budget deficits after a record gap of $98 billion last year, a stagnating economy and is being forced to cut the salaries of government employees.strong>OIL PRICE PRESSURES</strongSaudi Arabia is by far the largest OPEC producer with output of more than 10.7 million bpd, on par with Russia and the United States. Together, the three largest global producers extract a third of the world's oil.Iran's production has been stagnant at 3.6 million bpd in the past three months, close to pre-sanctions levels although Tehran says it wants to ramp up output to more than 4 million bpd when foreign investments in its fields kick in.Saudi oil revenue has halved over the past two years, forcing Riyadh to liquidate billions of dollars of overseas assets every month to pay bills and cut domestic fuel and utility subsidies last year.\"The Iranians have lived with a very tough macro backdrop for many years...\" said Raza Agha, chief Middle East economist at investment bank VTB Capital. \"So a sustained drop in oil prices has a more difficult social impact on Saudi.\"However, with unemployment in double digits, Tehran is also facing calls to maximize oil revenues and President Hassan Rouhani is under pressure from conservative opponents to deliver a faster economic recovery.Oil prices are well below the budget requirements of most OPEC nations. But attempts to reach an output deal have also been complicated by political rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which are fighting several proxy-wars in the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen.OPEC sources have said Saudi Arabia offered to reduce its output from summer peaks of 10.7 million bpd to around 10.2 million if Iran agreed to freeze production at around current levels of 3.6-3.7 million bpd.Riyadh has raised production in recent years to compete for market share while Iran's output was limited by sanctions.

Instead, they will take place as suspended President Dilma Rousseff faces an impeachment trial, the economy suffers its worst recession since the 1930s, an outbreak of the Zika virus prompts health concerns and a massive corruption scandal infuriates Brazilians.Mitidieri said his team is also investigating what happened to federal funds earmarked for cleaning Guanabara Bay, where Olympic sailing events will take place, and lakes that surround the main Olympic venues in western Rio's Barra neighborhood.Those bodies of water have heavy sewage contamination and remain badly polluted despite promises to drastically improve them as a legacy achievement of the Olympics.Another team of federal prosecutors, along with federal police, is investigating whether the Rio de Janeiro state water utility company Cedae committed environmental crimes by not properly treating sewage in Rio's metropolitan area of 12 million people, Mitidieri said.Rio utility Cedae said it had not been notified about the investigation and could not make a comment without understanding more about the probe.Mitidieri would not say if his team had uncovered any proof of corruption - but he added that detailed announcements about the investigation's results would be made in coming weeks.Five construction firms are building most of the 39 billion reais ($10.8 billion) worth of venues and infrastructure needed for Rio's Olympics. The figure includes at least 1.76 billion reais in federal funds, according to documents from Brazil's federal accounting court.All five companies are caught up in an investigation into price fixing and kickbacks at state-run oil company Petrobras, a two-year probe that has seen scores of top executives and politicians jailed, charged or under investigation.The Petrobras (PETR4.SA) investigation is what led federal police and prosecutors to begin looking at possible corruption tied to the Olympics.Federal authorities have already said they are investigating the Porto Maravilha project, an 8 billion real facelift of Rio's dilapidated port area, and also the expansion of the city's metro line to the Olympic area in Barra.Court files made public in March showed police uncovered documents from executives of Latin America's largest construction firm, Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL], that referenced 1 million reais in suspected bribes connected to those two big legacy projects.Odebrecht is at the center of the Petrobras scandal and is involved in over half of all Olympic projects by value, according to contracts reviewed by Reuters.A spokeswoman for Odebrecht said by email that the company had no comment to make.Mitidieri declined to provide details on which companies are the focus of the federal probe, though he did note that OAS SA [OAS.UL] and Queiroz Galvao had \"a lot of activity\" in the Deodoro region of the Olympics. OAS did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Queiroz Galvao wrote in an email that the company had not been notified about the investigation and had no further comment.Rio de Janeiro's city government oversees most Olympic construction projects, though a few are financed by the federal or state government. The city government says contracts were mostly funded with private resources and that all bids were overseen by regulators.Rio 2016, the local organizing committee, handles some non-permanent structures like seating, and has a budget of 7 billion reais.The federal government, Mitidieri noted, is by law responsible for any debts the local organizing committee may incur.The Rio 2016 local organizing committee referred questions to the mayor's office.The mayor's office said it would not comment without knowing what exact contracts were under investigation. It added in its emailed response that all contracts were carried out in a transparent manner and that city officials were prepared to provide any clarifications necessary.", "label": 0}, "external-43": {"text": "After being rattled out inside the first hour at Lord's, Pakistan needed to take their chances with the ball in order for their first-innings 339 to assume more daunting proportions. They proceeded to drop Alastair Cook twice, with his unbeaten 75 anchoring the England reply, but three wickets during the afternoon session for Yasir Shah kept Pakistan in the hunt.Chris Woakes' maiden five-wicket haul in Tests had helped finish off Pakistan with only 57 added to their overnight score before the stage was transported back to 2010, as Mohammad Amir prepared to bowl to Cook once again. Amir had previously removed Cook three times in five Tests and he should have added to that tally here but for glaring errors by Mohammad Hafeez, at first slip, and wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed.Cook put on 110 with Joe Root for the second wicket but Yasir struck for his first Test wickets outside of Asia to check England's advance. Root, in his first innings replacing Nick Compton at No. 3, looked at something like his dynamic best before trying slightly too hard to force the pace and top-edging a slog-sweep off Yasir straight up in the air to be taken at midwicket.That gave Pakistan a look at England's reshaped middle-order, with James Vince moving up to No. 4 above the recalled Gary Ballance. Vince briefly shimmered on an otherwise dull, cloudy afternoon, before playing back to be lbw to Yasir - DRS confirming it would have clipped leg stump - for a fifth innings without a significant score at Test level. Ballance clipped one four but was then beaten by a gently turning legbreak, pushing down the wrong line, to leave England 153 for 4 at tea.Amir's first delivery in Test cricket after a five-year ban for his involvement in spot-fixing on this ground was met by a few pseudo-witty cries of \"no-ball\" from the crowd and it was unceremoniously tucked away into the covers for a single by Cook. Amir struggled with his line and length, leaking 33 runs from six overs before lunch, but ought to have removed the England captain when he had made 22, slanting the ball in to take the edge just as he did as a teenager, only for Hafeez to make a mess of a straightforward low catch.Rahat Ali was more accurate with the new ball and he picked up Alex Hales in his first over, angling a delivery across to have him taken at third slip. Cook took advantage of too many deliveries on his pads to pick up seven boundaries - including another edge through the cordon off Amir - and score at more than a run a ball, as he and Root ticked up a fifty stand before lunch.There was further anguish for Amir when he began his second spell during the afternoon, his first delivery luring Cook into a drive as the ball left him, only for the ball to hit Sarfraz on the wrist as he dived to his left.In the morning session, a burst of three wickets in eight balls, including the dismissal of Misbah-ul-Haq for 114, had helped England wrap up Pakistan's innings. Woakes collected two of them to finish with 6 for 70 and join Misbah in having his name added to the honours board. Having been 282 for 4 shortly before the close on Thursday, Pakistan would have been disappointed to make only 339.Misbah, fresh from becoming the oldest captain to score a Test hundred, began the second day with designs on seeing his side up towards 400 and a secure position from which his bowlers could mount an attack. He could only add four runs to his overnight score, however, before Stuart Broad brought a delivery back to burst between bat and pad and rattle the stumps.That dismissal meant Pakistan had gone from 310 for 7 to 316 for 9, with Woakes removing Ahmed and Wahab Riaz in the preceding over. Sarfraz had looked in dangerous mood, frequently stepping down the pitch to cut and drive on his way to 25 from 29 deliveries but he gifted his wicket when slapping a short, wide delivery to backward point to give Woakes his maiden five-for.Two deliveries later, Wahab was following Sarfraz back to the pavilion, as Woakes followed up an excellent outswinger with one of the fastest balls of the match, full and ducking in past a flimsy defence to remove off stump from the ground.As the crowd applauded Woakes' achievements, Amir walked out for his first involvement in a Test since the corresponding Lord's Test in 2010. This was not the main event, of course, but he helped add 23 runs for the final wicket with Yasir Shah in an eventful cameo: his first ball was inside-edged for four over his stumps, the second, also from Broad, went flying off the back of his helmet. There were a couple more genuine boundary strokes before Amir steered Broad to second slip to complete a good morning's work for England.", "label": 0}, "external-44": {"text": "strong>SINGAPORE/ISLAMABAD: Chinese state-backed firms are frontrunners to buy a $1.5 billion controlling stake in Pakistani utility K-Electric, sources said.</strongState-backed Shanghai Electric Power and China Southern Power Grid are among Chinese firms leading the pack of<br/>about half a dozen bidders in K-Electric, one person familiar with the matter said.Shanghai-headquartered Golden Concord Holdings is also among the bidders, as are some local Pakistani and other companies, according to people who know about the process.Chinese companies\u00b4 interest comes after China last year announced energy and infrastructure projects worth $46 billion in the South Asian nation, with a view to opening a trade corridor linking western China with the Arabian Sea.\"The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is the main driver, with a lot of Chinese funding flowing into Pakistan,\"<br/>said one person aware of the K-Electric deal.That demand underpins President Xi Jinping\u00b4s ambitious \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative, under which Beijing is seeking to open new trade routes and markets as the domestic economy slows.Under the programme, Chinese companies invested nearly $15 billion in participating countries last year, up one fifth from 2014.If successful, the K-Electric deal would be the biggest M&amp;A agreement in Pakistan in a decade.

All this while questions were being\u00a0asked of whether life after Charlotte Edwards would really be so rosy.\u00a0Those answers will not be able to be given just yet, but Knight was understandably punchy in the press conference.\u00a0\u00a0\"There was a lot of noise around the squad before the series and the girls have responded. The cricket we have played has been really entertaining to watch. Everyone is feeding off the success of each other and it's been a really nice place to be.\"\u00a0That last point is key. Perhaps one of the most noticeable elements of this England side is how much more open they seem. And while players young and experienced have commented on how Robinson has created a relaxed atmosphere, it has been particularly clear\u00a0to former players no longer in the system.\u00a0\u00a0Caroline Atkins, who represented England between 2001 and 2011, was taken aback at how at ease the players were when she was around the team at Taunton as they prepared for the third ODI. It was not an atmosphere she was used to. Isa Guha and Ebony-Jewel Rainford-Brent have also presented caps to debutants during this tour, something that has rarely happened in English women's cricket. Rainford-Brent, who\u00a0 presented Hartley with her T20 cap before this match, was even invited into the team huddle -\u00a0a ringed haven usually reserved for squad members.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are of course elements that still need work. On a personnel level, Kate Cross' return to international cricket, after an impressive pre-season tour of Sri Lanka with the England Academy, was disappointing, as she took\u00a01 for 56 from the 11 overs she bowled across the first two ODIs. Cross will spend the next few weeks up to the\u00a0inaugural Women's Super League fine-tuning some technical aspects of her game, such as her front arm, before leading the Lancashire Tunder in what is hoped to be a testing\u00a0fortnight of high-level\u00a0cricket. She will hope her name will be added to the long list of seamers Robinson has healed.\u00a0\u00a0Long term, it will be interesting to see whether the confidence gained from these six matches can carry through into something more sustainable. This is not a team that likes to blow their own trumpet. But after six matches of runs, wickets and outright dominance, and given the manner in which they are looking to play their cricket, they might have to get used to it.", "label": 0}, "external-46": {"text": "DUBAI: Dubai property developers are still turning out some larger-than-life projects even though prices are heading south again after clawing back a good chunk of their losses in the 2008 crash.  The Gulf emirate\u00b4s annual Cityscape property fair opened Tuesday with developers foreseeing price declines of about 15 percent this year, yet confident there would be no return to the days when huge projects were abandoned half finished.Scale models of new skyscrapers, sprawling villa compounds and leisure centres, including a new indoor ski slope, were rolled out by several companies.Analysts have signalled a slide in property values, which had recovered significantly in the past two years after shedding half of their value in the 2008 global financial crisis. Dubai had shaken world markets when it signalled that it might default on huge debts incurred after borrowing extensively to build those ambitious projects.Thanks to the robust trade, tourism and transport sectors, the economy has since steadied. \"Residential prices have fallen maybe nine or 10 percent this year,\" said Craig Plumb, Middle East and North Africa research director for Chicago-based investment management company Jones Lang LaSalle.\"We expect prices to go down further over the rest of the year,\" saying the decline has \"more to do with what is going on globally. Things like (falling) oil prices and the global nervousness with the Chinese economy slowing.\"\"The Dubai residential market is very much affected by what\u00b4s going on in the rest of the world because a large number of people buying here are investors coming from overseas,\" said Plumb.\"There is a negative sentiment largely driven by oil prices... It pushed stock prices down and pushed sentiment against the residential market as well.\"The city-state, one of seven that make up the United Arab Emirates, is the largest and one of very few markets in the region that has opened up to foreign free-hold ownership. Plumb said prices are likely to fall for 12 more months, while forecasting the drop for this year at 15 percent. London-based property consultancy Knight Frank has reportedly put the annual drop to June at over 12 percent. Cluttons, another London consultancy, expects villa prices to lose up to seven percent in the second half of the year after dropping five percent in the first six months. Signs of price softening had begun to show as a result of strict regulations introduced by UAE financial authorities to avoid a new bubble, including mortgage caps.  In particular, they put a cap on mortgage financing at 75 percent for a first purchase and 60 percent for a second one. This priced out of the market those who could not make down payments of 25 percent or more. As a result, Plumb said, prices are not expected to nosedive as they did in the crisis.  \"We are seeing a much more stable market and that is a sign of better regulation.\"Developers undeterredAgainst that background, Cluttons said more than 40,000 units have been announced this year, with in excess of 20,000 to be delivered by 2017. Ziad Chaar, managing director of Dubai developer DAMAC Properties, said \"with 53 billion dirham ($14 billion) recorded transactions in the first six months... we are sure that this market is a good market.\"Chaar cited a growing population and healthy economic expansion, including a rising number of tourists and modern infrastructure, in addition to a stable exchange rate and political stability compared with a wider region in turmoil. \"If we did not know that this market is strong, and that there is a very strong demand, we would not have launched these projects,\" he said, pointing to scale models of various luxurious projects. One of the projects on display at Cityscape is Meydan One, which includes plans for the world\u00b4s highest residential tower, at 711 metres (2,333 feet) high. Dubai is already home to the world\u00b4s tallest building, Burj al-Khalifa, with stands at 829.8 metres. At foot of Meydan One, a 1.2-kilometre indoor ski slope is set to break Dubai\u00b4s own world record, Ski Dubai, which boasts a 400-metre slope.  Dubai\u00b4s Nakheel Properties, developer of Palm Jumeirah and the World Islands, announced that it aims to bring 10,000 units on to the market in the Jebel Ali area. Savills, another British real estate consultancy, ranks the UAE as the world second-best country for residential investment, after only the United States. It said Dubai\u00b4s market has \"matured\" and that softening prices are expected to pick up again in mid-2016, as the country prepares to host the Expo 2020 trade fair.", "label": 0}, "external-47": {"text": "WASHINGTON: Suddenly the online news business is red-hot. Money is flowing into digital news ventures at an unprecedented pace, as investors anticipate an accelerating shift away from traditional media, and new ways to generate revenue from news.BuzzFeed made news this past week with a $200 million capital injection from Comcast\u00b4s NBCUniversal, and with the announcement of a joint venture with Yahoo Japan for Japanese readers.Earlier this month, Vox Media also secured $200 million from NBCU as the startup seeks to ramp up its news websites including Vox.com, The Verge, Re/code and Bleacher Report.Vox and BuzzFeed joined the club of \"unicorns,\" or venture-funded startups worth at least $1 billion, a group which also includes Vice Media, which unveiled a $500 million funding round last year.The flood of capital to the sector suggests confidence in the ability of digital media to connect with readers -- especially younger audiences which eschew traditional media -- and generate profits, say analysts.\"Right now it\u00b4s an arms race. These are companies growing quickly and they have to grow quickly,\" said Ken Doctor, a media analyst with the research firm Outsell.Doctor said a key for these organization is capturing the attention of \"millennials,\" or young adults born after 1980 who rarely subscribe to print publications or cable television, and who get most of their content online.\"Marketers have discovered the millennial generation as they get more earning power,\" he told AFP.Interestingly, much of the money flowing into these organizations is coming from traditional media, seeking fresh ways to deal with a transition to digital news.The Murdoch family\u00b4s 21st Century Fox is an investor in Vice Media, for example, while Time Warner has invested in the online news site Mashable.\"It\u00b4s as much a hedge as anything else,\" Doctor said.\"It\u00b4s a lot of money but not a bank-breaking amount.\"Digital eats everything The analyst added that big media groups which saw troubles for print a decade ago are now waking up to digital disruption of television.With consumers slowly moving away from cable TV bundles, \"you can see the fault lines,\" Doctor said. \"Digital eats everything, and television is not immune.\"The more successful media startups have found ways to connect and use technology better than legacy firms, say some analysts.\"BuzzFeed and Vox and other high-profile startups make the claim they are not just content companies, they are tech companies,\" says Nikki Usher Layser, a journalism professor at George Washington University specializing in digital media.This means \"using data science to understand how information is spreading\" and being shared, she said, to better adapt news feeds and enable advertisers to reach specific segments of readers.BuzzFeed is known for using technology to help understand how news goes viral, while Mashable uses its own system for this. AOL, which owns news sites such as The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, is known for ad technology which measures effectiveness of online messages. Old, new media mergeRebecca Lieb, an independent media analyst and consultant, said she sees benefits from bringing old and new media together.Comcast\u00b4s NBC can reach young audiences by sharing video from programming including the Olympic Games.\"We\u00b4re seeing an era of declining television viewership and increased cord cutting,\" she told AFP.\"We have a large number of millennials who are never going to sign up for television packages so I\u00b4m sure NBC is hoping that BuzzFeed can help drive new audiences.\"For journalism, the good news is that this trend is driving investment in content, which means more hiring and in-depth reporting at a time when traditional newsroom job losses are accelerating.These large venture-funded news groups have been adding staff, along with smaller ones like Ozy, Fusion and Vocativ. Additionally, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar has pledged to invest $250 million in his online news operations, which include investigative site The Intercept.Doctor said most new media groups spend 60 to 70 percent of their budgets on news and content compared with just 12 percent for the newspaper industry.\"These companies have a belief that good content and appropriate content is a business driver,\" Doctor said.Still, it remains unclear if the companies are seeing an investment bubble which gives them unjustifiably high valuations.\"We have seen scant evidence of actual return of money to investors,\" Layser said. \"We have not seen a magic bullet that is going to make a clear pathway to profitability.\"", "label": 0}, "external-48": {"text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's car market has been dominated by Japanese automakers for decades, but a mini-economic revival looks set to attract new players from Europe and Korea into the mix.Despite heavy taxation on imported vehicles, enthusiasm for owning a car in Pakistan has remained undented \u0096 thanks in part to underdeveloped public transport in the country\u00b4s sprawling cities, but also the social status it brings.Toyota, Suzuki and Honda car assembly plants already work around the clock in the southern port city of Karachi and eastern Lahore \u0096 yet customers can still wait for up to four months for new vehicles to be delivered.Now demand for cars in the South Asian giant of 200 million people is accelerating even more quickly, as economic growth has reached its fastest pace since 2008 while renewed investor confidence and easing inflation have spurred consumer spending.Keen to cash in, a delegation from German auto giant Volkswagen visited the country in recent weeks, according to Pakistani officials and German diplomats.Company spokesman Christoph Adomat told AFP that while \"Volkswagen is constantly evaluating market opportunities on a worldwide basis... there are no decisions for an investment from Volkswagen side in Pakistan\".Miftah Ismail, the chairman of Pakistan Board of Investment who took part in the talks, said Volkswagen was not the only company expressing an interest. \"There are a number of other companies from (South) Korea and Europe that we are talking to who are thinking of setting up assembly plants in Pakistan,\" he said, without naming the firms.Japanese strangleholdUS and European cars dominated Pakistan\u00b4s roads in the early years after it gained independence from Britain in 1947.But fuel prices made their compact, efficient Japanese rivals more popular and from the 1960s onwards manufacturers like Toyota, Suzuki and Honda gained a stranglehold on the market.Italy's Fiat made a brief foray in the 1990s, while South Korea\u00b4s Hyundai as well as Daewoo-owned Chevrolet tried \u0096 and failed \u0096 to gain a foothold in the 2000s before the financial crisis forced them to exit.Because Pakistan charges heavy duties on imported cars less than three years old, Japanese companies with in-country assembly operations can set prices significantly above the regional average.The bottom-of-the-range Suzuki Mehran costs the equivalent of $6,300 in Pakistan but sells for around $3,900 in neighbouring India. The most popular Corolla 1.3 sedan starts at 1.6 million rupees ($16,000), but buyers have to wait months or pay $1,500 for prompt delivery.The news that Volkswagen was exploring options to enter the Pakistani market has excited car enthusiasts, who are tired of high prices and limited choices.\"I think it is a great idea because Volkswagen cars are value for money and reliability,\" said Romano Karim, a fan of the classic Volkswagen Beetles from the 60s and 70s that can often be seen on Pakistan\u00b4s roads.Haji Mohammad Shahzad, chairman of the All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association, added that having Volkswagen in the market would help drive costs down.\"The monopoly of big three could be broken if Volkswagen produces at least 20,000-25,000 cars annually,\" Shahzad told AFP.Renewed confidenceGlobal auto giants are attracted by Pakistan\u00b4s booming economy, which the International Monetary Fund predicts will grow by 4.5 percent in the next financial year. Investor confidence in the medium-sized economy of $232 billion has improved since a new business-friendly government led by Nawaz Sharif took power in 2013, with Karachi\u00b4s share market among the world\u00b4s top 10 performers in the past year.The country is also undergoing a major construction boom driven by Chinese investment after President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad in April to unveil a $46 billion investment plan known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.Car sales have also boomed thanks to the growth of car leasing and financing facilities. Sales in the 11 months to May this year rose 30 percent from a year earlier, according to industry group the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association.Baber Kaleem Khan, editor of PakWheels.com magazine, said Volkswagen would be well poised to tap into the lower to mid-range market.\"Pakistani automakers haven\u00b4t really had much competition because their respective domains are well protected by monopolistic business practices,\" Khan told AFP.\"But given VW\u00b4s impressive small-range of vehicles, the German automaker can take the market from the ground up and start working to the top.\"", "label": 0}, "external-49": {"text": "strong>TOKYO: Asian shares got off to a rocky start on Monday after mixed U.S. jobs data helped sink shares on Wall Street, but trade was thin with many regional markets closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 percent, with Australian shares slipping about the same amount.Japan's Nikkei pared early steep losses, helped by a weaker yen, but it also was down 0.2 percent by midday.\"We didn't get much clues on future U.S. rate hikes from the jobs report, so investors are having hard times deciding their positions,\" said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities.\"Japanese companies' earnings reports are not helping sentiment, either, so the market may stay sluggish for a while.\"U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by just 151,000 jobs last month, falling well short of expectations for a rise of 190,000.But the unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent, the lowest since February 2008, and wages rose, indicating some signs of underlying strength in the labour market despite the weak headline figure.With Singapore, Hong Kong and mainland China all closed for the new year holiday, \"volumes will be well below average and there tends to be a build-up of global leads that is released once Asian investors return to their desk \u0096 expect 'release valve trading late in the week,\" Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG in Melbourne, wrote in a note to clients.Markets in China, a focus of recent market concern, will be closed for the entire week for the holiday.Data released over the weekend showed China's foreign reserves fell for a third straight month in January, as the central bank dumped dollars to defend the yuan and prevent an increase in capital outflows.Beijing has been struggling to underpin the yuan, which faces depreciation pressure as China's growth rate slows to its lowest levels in a quarter of a century.\"Just as China's persistent accumulation of foreign reserves in the first decade of the 21st century signalled that its managed currency was undervalued, its persistent loss of foreign reserves signals that the yuan has become overvalued by market criteria,\" economist Bill Adams at PNC Financial Services Group said in a research note.\"There is a large probability that China's central bank tires of spending its foreign reserves to defend an overvalued currency in the near future.

In winning a major tournament he surpasses Portugal greats Eusebio and Luis Figo.Having also won last season\u00b4s Champions League, he has a stolen a march on his great rival Lionel Messi, who announced his Argentina retirement two weeks ago, in the race for the next FIFA Ballon d\u00b4Or.Taken off in the 25th minute, he returned at the start of extra time to deliver on-pitch pep talks that appeared to inspire his team to victory.Eder saw a header pushed out by France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, while Raphael Guerreiro hit the bar from a free-kick.With 11 minutes of the extra period to play, the killer goal arrived as Eder held off Laurent Koscielny and drove a crisp shot into the bottom-left corner from 25 yards.\"Cristiano told me I would be scoring the winning goal,\" Eder said. \"He gave me strength and positive energy.\"/><strong>Ronaldo applauded</strongThe sultry night began with a swarm of moths flitting around the French national stadium and littering the playing surface.There was an early exchange of chances -- Nani shooting over for Portugal, Griezmann\u00b4s header drawing a fine finger-tip save from Rui Patricio -- before Ronaldo took centre-stage.A juddering knee-on-knee challenge by Payet in the eighth minute left Ronaldo writhing on the turf and after attempting to play on, he dropped to the ground, tears filling his eyes.After having his left knee heavily strapped, Ronaldo re-entered the fray, only to go down again, flinging his armband to the floor.A stretcher was brought on and as the Portugal captain was carried off, to be replaced by Ricardo Quaresma, the whole stadium rose to applaud.France\u00b4s Moussa Sissoko stepped into the spotlight vacated by Ronaldo, driving a left-foot shot over the bar and then stinging Rui Patricio\u00b4s palms after nutmegging Adrien Silva with a slick Cruyff turn.But it took the 58th-minute introduction of Kingsley Coman to enliven France. The Bayern Munich winger crossed for Griezmann to head over and released Olivier Giroud for a shot that Rui Patricio parried.Rui Patricio also repelled a 25-yard effort from Sissoko and when France substitute Andre-Pierre Gignac neatly sidestepped the fit-again Pepe in stoppage time, he could only scuff his shot against the post.", "label": 0}, "external-53": {"text": "strong>TOKYO: Asian stocks retreated on Monday after a weekend meeting of G20 policymakers ended with no new coordinated action to spur global growth and as solid US data revived expectation of the Federal Reserve further raising rates before year-end.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.4 percent and appeared likely to post its second consecutive month of losses, with a 1.0 percent drop so far this month.Japan's Nikkei gained 0.4 percent largely on the overnight fall in the yen, though it looks set to log its third monthly fall in a row with decline of 7.2 percent so far.Mainland Chinese shares fell sharply with the bluechip CSI 300 Index briefly hitting a 15-month low.Disappointing earnings results released over the weekend, the lack of concrete measures from the group of 20 economies and political implications from the latest cyberspace crackdown by Beijing were all cited as a culprit.G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed to use \"all policy tools \u0096 monetary, fiscal and structural \u0096 individually and collectively\" to reach the group's economic goals, citing a series of risks to world growth.\"The G20 communique basically says 1) the world is not as bad a place as markets think; and 2) if it gets worse we will use fiscal, monetary and structural policy aggressively to fix it,\" Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX Strategy at CitiFX, said in a note to clients.\"In baseball parlance, they were aiming for a single in terms of restoring confidence and they probably achieved it,\" he added.While some market players say the statement could mildly underpin market sentiment, the lack of any concrete action - especially on fiscal stimulus as some had speculated - was seen as a disappointment.A pledge in the statement to \"consult closely\" on foreign exchange markets was also seen by some market players as hindering a few countries from adopting flexible policy actions.On the other hand, fresh US economic data published on Friday revived expectations of Federal Reserve rate increases, helping to lift US bond yields and the dollar.Consumer spending rose solidly in January and underlying inflation picked up by the most in four years. Gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter was revised higher, to a 1.0 percent annual rate\"The US economy doesn't look too bad after all. So some people seem to start thinking that the Fed's rate hike could be back on the agenda,\" said Bart Wakabayashi, head of forex at State Street.The figures prompted Federal funds rate futures to price in a more than 50 percent chance of one rate hike by the end of year, compared to almost zero percent chance in mid-February.The two-year US Treasuries yield also hit a four-week high of 0.817 percent on Friday and last stood at 0.797 percent versus its Feb 11 low of 0.582 percent.The greenback's yield allure helped lift the dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies to a three-week high of 98.26 on Friday. It last stood at 98.13.As the dollar gained, the euro fetched $1.0920, having slipped to a three-week low of $1.0912 on Friday. In early Asia on Monday, it traded at $1.0931, flat on the day.The yen also slipped to one-week low of 114 to the dollar on Friday but bounced back 0.5 percent on Monday to 113.41.Still, with gains of 6.8 percent in February, the yen remains the best performing major currency this month as concerns over slowing global growth fanned buying in safe-haven assets.In contrast, fears of \"Brexit\" offered traders a good excuse to sell the British pound, which fell to a seven-year low of $1.3841.Although the British government managed to get G20 to agree to include a warning against \"Brexit\" in the statement, that appeared to have limited impact. The British currency is down 2.7 percent on month.Equally under pressure was the South Korean won, which fell to 5-1/2-year lows, shedding 3.4 percent this month, on worries about growth prospects in China and tensions with North Korea, despite suspected intervention by Seoul to stem the currency's fall.Elsewhere, the oil markets maintain their firmness as short-sellers have reduced their positions following major oil producing countries' decision to freeze output earlier this month.While the measure is unlikely to solve the persistent supply glut in the market, it was seen as a first step for further cooperation in the future.International Brent futures climbed 1.1 percent from their last close to $35.49 per barrel, 2.2 percent above its levels at the end of January.", "label": 0}, "external-54": {"text": "strong>SANYA, CHINA: China's efforts to lift local consumption, spur domestic tourism and keep within its borders citizens that splurge in Milan or Seoul have spawned a duty-free paradise on the southern island of Hainan that it hopes will satisfy a lust for luxury.</strongFirms such as the owner of the world's biggest duty-free shopping centre, China International Travel Service Corp Ltd (CITS), are capitalising on a relaxation of duty-free spending restrictions in February, with HNA Group Co Ltd reporting a 160 percent surge in sales.Government initiatives, including 19 more duty-free shops nationwide, come as sales of the types of luxury goods that line duty-free shelves fell 2 percent last year.

From February 1, they have been able to make purchases any time of the year provided the total does not exceed 16,000 yuan. At the same time, stores have also been able to sell goods online for collection at airports.In Hainan's provincial capital Haikou in the north of the island, HNA's duty-free sales have since rocketed.In the island's city of Sanya, state-controlled CITS opened the country's first duty-free shopping centre in 2014. The skylit, flower-shaped edifice is about nine soccer pitches in size and filled with shops stocking over 300 brands including from Burberry Group PLC and Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA, as well as goods such as baby formula.\"It's definitely much cheaper,\" said 20-something handbag shopper Zhang Pei Pei, \"But the choice of products is less.\"CITS declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.strong>HOTEL RUSH</strongHainan's balmy climate and over 60 beaches is a draw for developers, with Sanya on the island's southern tip dotted with luxurious resorts completed or under construction.

OPEC has no supply limit, having at its last meeting in December scrapped its production target.According to International Energy Agency (IEA) figures, Iran's output has reached levels seen before the imposition of sanctions over its nuclear program. Tehran says it is not yet there.But while Iran may be more willing now to talk, an increase in oil prices has reduced the urgency of propping up the market, OPEC delegates say. Oil has risen toward a more producer-friendly $50 from a 12-year low near $27 in January.\"I don't think OPEC will decide anything,\" a delegate from a major Middle East producer said. \"The market is recovering because of supply disruptions and demand recovery.\"A senior OPEC delegate, asked whether the group would make any changes to output policy at its June 2 meeting, said: \u0093Nothing. The freeze is finished.\u0094Within OPEC, Iran has long pushed for measures to support oil prices. That position puts it at odds with Saudi Arabia, the driving force behind OPEC's landmark November 2014 refusal to cut supply in order to boost the market.Sources familiar with Iranian oil policy see no sign of any change of approach by Riyadh under new Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih - who is seen as a believer in reform and low oil prices.\"It really depends on those countries within OPEC with a high level of production,\" one such source said. \"It does not seem that Saudi Arabia will be ready to cooperate with other members.\"HIGHER EXPORTSIran has managed to increase oil exports significantly in 2016 after the lifting of sanctions in January.It notched up output of 3.56 million barrels of oil per day in April, the IEA said, a level last reached in November 2011 before sanctions were tightened.Saudi Arabia produced a near-record-high 10.26 million barrels per day in April and has kept output relatively steady over the past year, its submissions to OPEC show.Iran, according to delegates from other OPEC members, is unlikely to restrain supplies, given that it believes Saudi Arabia should cut back itself to make room for Iranian oil.\"Iran won't support any freeze or cut,\" said a non-Iranian OPEC delegate. \"But Iran may put pressure on Saudi Arabia that they hold the responsibility.\"Saudi thinking, however, has moved on from the days when Riyadh cut or increased output unilaterally. Talks in Doha on the proposed output freeze by OPEC and non-OPEC producers fell through after Saudi insisted that Iran participate.Indeed, differences between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which helped found the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 56 years ago, over OPEC policy have made cooperation harder - to say nothing of more fundamental disagreements.For more than a decade after oil crashed to $10 in 1997, the two set aside rivalries to manage the market and support prices, although they fell into opposing OPEC camps with Iran wanting high prices and Saudi more moderate.Now, the Sunni-Shia conflicts setting Saudi Arabia and Iran at each other's throats, particularly in Syria and Yemen, make the relationship between the two even more fraught.The two disagree over OPEC's future direction. Earlier in May, OPEC failed to decide on a long-term strategy as Saudi Arabia objected to Iran's proposal that the exporter group aim for \"effective production management\".With that backdrop, ministers may be advised to keep expectations low, an OPEC watcher said.\"The only aspiration OPEC should have for its 2 June meeting is simply not to repeat the chaos of the Doha process,\" said Paul Horsnell, analyst at Standard Chartered.\"A straightforward meeting with no binding commitments and, most importantly, no overt arguments would be the best outcome for ministers.\"", "label": 0}, "external-56": {"text": "strong>WASHINGTON: Handing out multibillion-dollar fines right and left to domestic and foreign financial giants, the United States has taken on the role of the unforgiving global cop of the business world.</strongIn stark contrast to the relative inertia of white-collar law enforcement in Europe, Washington most recently brought the hammer down on Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, which sold junk-filled, mortgage-backed securities ahead of the 2008 financial meltdown.Deutsche Bank has agreed to a payout of $7.2 billion, while Credit Suisse settled for $5.3 billion to resolve American authorities\u00b4 allegations and avoid the lengthy headache of a trial.Instead of dragging financial firms to court, the US has taken them to the cashier.American giants have not been spared: JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America collectively have shelled out $40 billion to settle cases linked to toxic, crisis-era financial products.\"There\u00b4s a kind of fundamentalism to US law,\" said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel and the Washington-based Peterson Institute.\"If you break the law, punishment comes down.\"- Justice without borders -To be sure, British authorities have taken action over the Libor interest rate manipulation scandal but such retribution remains rare in the rest of Europe.\"It isn\u00b4t so much a difference in the rules as in the manner in which they are applied. Things are much more severe in the United States,\" Veron told AFP, adding that European countries \"do not dare\" punish their national flagship companies.The American legal framework nevertheless offers the United States the means to extend the long arm of the law well beyond its borders.In the most recent cases, the United States imposed $2.6 billion in criminal penalties on the Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht -- most of which will be paid to Brazil -- and a half billion on the Israeli generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical. Both matters involved corruption occurring outside the United States.The United States pioneered the prosecution of such foreign bribery cases, adopting the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977 in the wake of the Watergate scandal, which allows US officials to hunt down corrupt payments abroad when the companies involved are traded on Wall Street or are otherwise exposed to US jurisdiction.In the decades since, member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have adopted similar laws but do not enforce them with the same vigor or frequency.Given the means and opportunity to apply its laws \"extraterritorially\" with such regularity, the United States has become a kind of worldwide anticorruption police force, and buttressed its geopolitical influence.\"There\u00b4s a real nexus between economics and foreign affairs,\" said Aaron Klein, head of the center on regulation and markets at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\"The next war is more likely to be fought with bonds than with bombs.\"- Making Apple pay -In a different kind of case, Volkswagen\u00b4s sprawling emissions-cheating scandal also has shown the might of the US legal system and its ability to bring major companies to task.To compensate drivers and repair damage to the environment, the giant German automaker has agreed to pay out more than $15 billion so far, and doubtless will have to pay more before putting the scandal behind it. But the company still could face criminal charges.<br/>In Europe, authorities have also opened investigations into Volkswagen but by their own admission, the results will be much less spectacular.\"In the European Union, the way to damages is more complicated than in the United States,\" EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said in September.In the United States, authorities can be supported in their actions by so-called class-action lawsuits brought collectively by groups of private individuals who have been wronged, which can ratchet up pressure on companies. But this option does exist in Europe.European authorities meanwhile have not been completely dormant in dealing with major companies. They have opened numerous anti-trust investigations and intensified their pursuit of tax avoidance and evasion by multinational companies.Making perhaps its biggest splash to date, the European Commission at the end of August directed the iPhone maker Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($13.5 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, drawing the ire of a sizeable player: the United States.", "label": 0}, "external-57": {"text": "strong>Soccer rivalry and fan violence spilled into global politics as Moscow summoned the French ambassador over detentions of Russians at Euro 2016 and warned an \"anti-Russian\" mood could even damage relations between Russia and France.</strongRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused other countries' football fans of \"absolutely provocative actions\" at the tournament, such as trampling on the Russian flag.Police used pepper spray and tear gas to disperse English soccer fans on Wednesday near the train station in the northern city of Lille, a police source said.They intervened after fans starting running in all directions following a detonation of unknown origin, the source told Reuters.

In an e-mailed statement, the company said it had \"no news to announce at this time\".Nissan chief spokesman Jonathan Adashek said: \"Pakistan is certainly a market of interest for us at present\", but added no final decision had been made.strong>STABILITY</strongAnalysts say the odds are stacked against Pakistan finalising deals, despite the concessions on offer.A major obstacle is the perennial concern about political stability.The threat of militant attacks also remains high, despite the armed forces' long-running campaign against groups including the Taliban.Foreign companies have been reluctant to invest large sums when the long-term outlook is so uncertain.\"There is potential in Pakistan. There is no doubt about that,\" said Puneet Gupta, associate director at consultant IHS Automotive. \"(But) we really don't feel Pakistan is in a relatively stable condition, from a mid to long-term perspective.\"Another potential turn off for investors is the size of Pakistan's car market, where 180,000 cars were sold in the 2014/2015 fiscal year. That compares with more than 2 million passenger vehicles a year in neighbouring India.\"The Pakistan market is not big enough,\" said Mumshad Ali, chairman of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts.He added that the government's new policies were probably not bold enough to tempt new manufacturers, nor did they address ways to increase demand, such as lowering sales taxes.The local manufacturing partners of Suzuki, Toyota and Honda did not respond to requests for comment.But Ali said they felt aggrieved that the government was favouring new investors and believed they should be similarly encouraged to build new plants and expand existing factories.Ismail said new entrants would be able to import machinery for plants duty free. Customs duty for importing car parts has been set at 10 percent, while existing players will have to pay 30 percent.\"We want greater competition, and we expect with greater competition consumers will be offered better choices,\" he said.Some Pakistanis are frustrated by high prices and the quality of locally produced cars, which tend not to have airbags, anti-lock breaking systems (ABS) and other features considered standard elsewhere.The cheapest Pakistani car, the Suzuki Mehran, sells for 650,000 Pakistani rupee ($6,200), or about double the price of a comparable model in India.\"Local cars are so bad,\" said Ali Paracha, owner of a car rental company. \"The market has been in need of an overhaul for at least a decade or two.\"", "label": 0}, "external-61": {"text": "LEEDS: Jonny Bairstow brought up his second Test century, and his first on his home ground at Headingley, as England continued their fightback on the second morning of the first Test against Sri Lanka. However, with Alex Hales falling short in his own quest for three figures, Sri Lanka battled back with three wickets in the second hour of the session, and will be armed with a brand-new ball when play resumes after lunch.Continuing the theme that Hales and Bairstow had established on the first afternoon, the pair extended their sixth-wicket stand to 141 to banish the memories of England's top-order wobble, when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs. Bairstow was once again the aggressor, as befits a man in supreme form on his Yorkshire home ground - his last two innings at the venue have been 246 and 198.Bairstow outscored his partner by three to one throughout their morning resumption, capitalising on too much width as both Sri Lanka openers, Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep, offered opportunities to fillet the third-man boundary. He did enjoy one clear moment of good fortune however, on 70, when Pradeep failed to gather a sharp return catch to his right, as Bairstow scuffed a drive back down the track.At the other end, Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century. It was a grind, as he routinely refused to chase anything outside his eyeline, except for one clear opportunity on 82, when Dimuth Karunaratne failed to cling onto a flying edge at slip off the bowling off Angelo Mathews.It could have been the slice of luck that Hales needed. But four runs later, and faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack, Hales' patience snapped for good. In Herath's second over, he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers. A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover, who pouched the offering with a well-judged dive.Hales was visibly distraught, lingering at the crease for several seconds and looking as though he wanted to snap his errant bat in two. Though he belatedly acknowledged the crowd as he dragged himself from the field, he knew that he had thrown away a priceless opportunity to silence those who doubt his credentials as a Test match opener.It could have set his summer up at the first opportunity. Instead, having added 15 runs to his overnight 71 in 52 deliveries, with a dropped catch thrown in the mix as well, he will know that the jury remains out. At least, for those of a superstitious bent, he had guaranteed his fate would be different to the last two England openers to make a maiden Test hundred at Headingley - both Sam Robson (2014) and Adam Lyth (2015) were out of the side by the end of the summer.If Hales' failing had been to linger too long, then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali. England's No. 8 had admitted before the match that he had lost a bit of confidence in being slated to come in so low for his country, but the hasty manner in which he came and went didn't exactly enhance his case for a promotion. He had failed to score from his first seven deliveries when he drove too firmly at his eighth, from Dushmantha Chameera, and lobbed a simple catch off the inside edge and pad, to Kusal Mendis under the helmet at short leg.It was a timely reward for the slippery Chameera, bowling only his second over of the day. He had erred on the short side in his fruitless first day's work, but was soon celebrating two wickets in the space of five deliveries when Stuart Broad drove flat-footedly at a hint of width outside off and spread-eagled his own stumps via an inside edge.Bairstow simply stared down the track, rather nonplussed by the clatter of wickets in his midst. But he didn't have to wait long to reframe the story of the session. From the first ball of Chameera's next over, Bairstow drilled a drive into the covers, paused as a wild shy came in at the non-striker's end, then galloped through with glee as the ball zipped through for overthrows to gift him his second century and his first on home soil. Coming at the ground where his late father, David, played for so many years, it was a moment that he may yet cherish even more than his emotional first century, at Cape Town five months ago.", "label": 0}, "external-62": {"text": "strong>TOKYO/SINGAPORE: Asian shares extended losses to three-week lows on Friday, while the yen soared to a 17-month high against the dollar as investors bet Japan would be hard pressed to drive down its currency in the face of widespread foreign opposition.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent, heading for a weekly drop of 1.8 percent.Japan's Nikkei pared earlier losses to near-two-month lows to trade 0.6 percent lower, with financials under pressure.

In April, its executive director told trade publication Home and Textiles Today that it had tested retail products labeled 'Egyptian cotton' and found that 90 percent contained no Egyptian cotton at all.The Cotton Egypt Association lists Welspun as one of just three companies permitted to label its products with the association's \"Gold Seal,\" which was launched earlier this year and is meant to ensure authenticity.Mukesh Saviani, a Welspun executive, told the trade publication in February that the seal was \"an assurance to retailers that they will not get into any compliance issues.\"The scandal could leave big box U.S. retailers wary of dealing with products labeled Egyptian cotton, potentially providing a boon to growers of U.S. Pima cotton in places like California and Arizona.\"The Supima boys are doing backflips and pirouettes on their desks right now,\" Lawson said, referring to an association that provides a trademark indicating cotton products come from 100 percent American Pima cotton.", "label": 0}, "external-64": {"text": "BRASILIA: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang lifted the wraps Tuesday on a multibillion-dollar series of trade and investment deals with Brazil, as Beijing looks to invest $53 billion in South America\u0092s largest economy.The news unveiled at the start of Li\u00b4s first official visit to Latin America is a huge boon for Brazil as it endures a fifth straight year of low growth after a period of rapid expansion fueled by Asian demand for commodities that has since slowed.Li\u00b4s host, President Dilma Rousseff, hopes Brazil can direct Chinese cash to overhaul decaying infrastructure as the country\u00b4s tourist magnet Rio de Janeiro prepares to host South America\u00b4s first ever Olympics next year.Headlining 35 deals on Li\u00b4s first official visit to Latin America were a pair of finance and cooperation agreements worth $7 billion for Brazil\u00b4s state-owned oil firm Petrobras.Rousseff, who will make a state visit next year to China, spoke of a \"new intensity in our relations.\"\"China and Brazil are playing a leading role in the construction of a new global order,\" she added.Rousseff, re-elected in October, has been battling a welter of negative economic data as well as fallout from a huge graft scandal at Petrobras.Li pointed to China\u00b4s \"rich experience\" in building infrastructure, saying Beijing \"would like to cooperate with Brazil in reducing its costs.\"Despite a multibillion-dollar kickbacks scandal battering its reputation as Brazil\u00b4s flagship company, Petrobras had earlier this year received another Beijing boost in signing a $3.5 billion financing deal with the China Investment Bank.Despite becoming Brazil\u00b4s number one trading partner in 2009, amid an exponential rise in two-way trade, China currently ranks only 12th in terms of actual investment in Brazil, prompting Brasilia to seek deeper economic ties.The Chinese are notably supplying new metro trains and catamarans to Rio and Li will visit the Olympic host city Wednesday to inspect those investments before leaving Thursday for Colombia ahead of trips to Peru and Chile.Li\u00b4s tour, aimed at underpinning growing Chinese influence in Latin America, comes just days after Beijing signed accords worth $25 billion and $22 billion respectively with fellow BRICS developing nations Russia. But the Brazil package is worth more than those combined.- Air deals, railroad dreams -Aside from the Petrobras agreements, Rousseff and Li also signed a range of deals designed to further bilateral cooperation on trade, investment, agriculture, energy and transport.Brasilia and Beijing also finalised a $1.3 billion accord to sell 22 Brazilian Embraer commercial jets to China\u00b4s Tianjin Airlines, Embraer said.Brazil\u00b4s Vale, the world\u00b4s biggest iron producer, announced a range of deals including extended cooperation with China on maritime transport of iron ore.Among the deals, Vale said it would expand an existing accord by selling four ore carriers to China Merchants Energy Shipping Co. Ltd and also also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for up to $4 billion in loans and other financial arrangements.China also vowed to lift an import ban on Brazilian beef and signed onto an ambitious project to build a railway from the key southeastern Brazilian port of Santos more than 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) to the Peruvian Pacific port of Ilo.- Exponential growth -Bilateral trade between the BRICS developing states has mushroomed over the past decade, with the Asian giant becoming Brazil\u00b4s main trading partner in 2009.Trade between China and Latin America as a whole exploded from barely $10 billion in 2000 to $255.5 billion in 2012.Sino-Brazilian trade mushroomed from $6.5 billion in 2003 to $83.3 billion in 2012.Ahead of Li\u00b4s arrival late Monday, Jose Graca Lima, head of Asian affairs in the Brazilian foreign ministry, explained that a \"second generation\" of Chinese investment is underway, switching from trade in raw materials to heavy industry and infrastructure.Facilitating the movement of imports from Brazil -- and similarly that of its own exports to Latin America -- is a key Chinese aim, pushing their interest in funding the mooted $10 billion railway project through to Peru.Building the rail link would mean that \"a new path to Asia will open up for Brazil, reducing distances and costs,\" Rousseff told reporters.", "label": 0}, "external-65": {"text": "strong>NEW YORK: It's a bird, it's a plane, and it\u0092s a ... financial planner?

They thought because cost was high, prices will remain high ... (but) then there was the advent of shale. Since that period, there is a realization that there is no scarcity of oil.\"The shale revolution turned the United States into one of the world's biggest oil producers, at a time when exporters in the Middle East and Russia were also pumping out record volumes, causing oil prices LCOc1 to more than halve since mid-2014 to under $50 per barrel.The FPSO Opportunity, which has been laid up for over two years, was built in 1972 and operated by Chevron CV.N and Australia's Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX) before being taken over by a Bermuda-registered FPSO Opportunity Inc in 2011.

Now, they are suspending operations as a surge in smuggled bullion wipes out wafer thin margins.</strongGold importing banks and big jewelers have also been hit by the growing entry of illicit gold, which avoids import duties and makes its way on to the so-called \"grey market\" where it is sold to end-users at a discount.Smuggled gold could account for more than a third of demand this year in India - the world's second-biggest buyer of the metal after China - potentially costing the government over $1 billion in lost revenue.The upsurge will lead to pressure for a reduction in the 10 percent import duty and a rethink on recently introduced levies on gold jewelry, which critics say are boosting the unofficial trade the government has been trying to curb.\"Gold refiners have less than a 1 percent margin. If smugglers offer 4 or 5 percent discounts, then we have no choice but to close our operations,\" James Jose, secretary of the Association of Gold Refineries and Mints told Reuters.All 32 refineries in the country have stopped buying dore - a semi-pure alloy made by miners - in the past few months and are relying on treating scrap gold until market conditions normalize, he said.\"Last fiscal year we refined 120 tonnes of gold.

At 300 tonnes, the government would forego about $1.3 billion at current gold prices.The new sales tax has encouraged smaller jewelers in particular to buy on the grey market, said Somasundaram PR, managing director of the WGCs' Indian operations. The jewelry must be sold without receipts, but goes to customers looking to hide funds from the authorities.The finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment on gold smuggling.strong>BANKS HIT</strongThe legal trade is also facing headwinds from a 26 percent rise in the gold price this year which has discouraged overall buying and made smuggled gold available at deep discounts.India's official gold imports fell 57 percent in the first seven months of 2016 to 215 tonnes, and could fall more than 60 percent for the year to 350 tonnes to 400 tonnes, the lowest level in two decades, said Sunil Kashyap, managing director, Global Banking and Markets at Scotiabank.Banks, which until last year were the main source of gold supply, are losing their market share quickly.\"Since there were hefty discounts in the grey market, consumers shifted from banks to grey markets,\" Arindam Sarkar, senior vice president at Axis Bank, the biggest bullion importing bank in the country, told Reuters.\"So far in 2016 our bullion business is down nearly 75 percent,\" he said.Bigger, more reputable jewelers are also suffering.\"Small jewelers buy gold at 4 or 5 percent discount and then sell jewelry at 1 or 2 percent discount,\" said Aditya Pethe, a director at Waman Hari Pethe Jewellers in Mumbai.\"The business of big jewelers like us is getting affected.But jewelers buying from the grey market say they have little choice.\"I wasn't buying gold from grey market for months, but others were buying and doing business,\" said a Mumbai-based jeweler, who declined to be identified.\"In the last two months I've also started buying as I have to survive.

For the month, it was down 16 percent and for the year, it fell 35 percent. In 2014, Brent lost 48 percent.WTI rose 44 cents to $37.04 a barrel. It slid 11 percent in December and 30 percent for the year, after a 46 percent loss in 2014.The immediate outlook for oil prices remains bleak. Goldman Sachs has said prices as low as $20 per barrel might be necessary to push enough production out of business and allow a rebalancing of the market.Adding to oil's woes, floods across the Midwestern United States were threatening refineries and pipelines from Illinois to Louisiana, potentially swelling the glut of domestic crude at a time when stockpiles were already at record highs.A mild winter so far in the Northern Hemisphere due to the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon has also slashed demand for heating oil. U.S. heating oil prices fell 40 percent for a second year in a row.\"We have brimming oil inventories in Europe,\" Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB in Oslo, said. \"And our predictions are that oil inventories in Asia are going to get closer to saturation in the first quarter.\"Morgan Stanley said in its outlook for next year that \"headwinds (are) growing for 2016 oil.\"The bank cited ongoing increases in available global supplies, despite some cuts by U.S. shale drillers. \"The hope for a rebalancing in 2016 continues to suffer serious setbacks,\" it said.strong>INDUSTRY PAIN</strongBrent prices briefly hit a 2004 bottom below $36 a barrel last week, effectively wiping out gains from a decade-long commodity super-cycle sparked by China's once-inexorable growth and energy demand boom.The downturn in oil has caused pain across the energy supply chain, including to shippers, private oil drillers and oil-dependent countries from Venezuela and Russia to the Middle East.Analysts estimate global crude production exceeds demand anywhere between half a million and 2 million barrels a day. This means even the most aggressive estimates of expected U.S. production cuts of 500,000 bpd for 2016 would be unlikely to fully rebalance the market.Oil began falling in mid-2014 as surging output from OPEC, Russia and U.S. shale producers outpaced demand. The downturn accelerated at the end of 2014 after a Saudi-led OPEC decision to keep production high to defend global market share rather than cut output to support prices.OPEC failed to agree on any production targets at its Dec. 4 meeting in Vienna, cementing its decision to protect market share, as the world braces for the return of Iranian crude exports to the market after the lifting of Western sanctions against Tehran.Russia is also showing no signs of reining in production, prompting traders, hedge fund managers and other speculators to establish record high active short positions in the market that would profit from further crude price falls.", "label": 0}, "external-70": {"text": "WASHINGTON: BuzzFeed, the website which lives off viral and \"shareable\" news, got a major boost for expansion plans Tuesday with a $200 million investment from NBCUniversal.The deal with NBCU, a division of the media and cable conglomerate Comcast, calls for \"strategic partnerships\" between the two groups, which could allow sharing of content between BuzzFeed and the vast NBC television operations.The deal values the \"social news\" pioneer at some $1.5 billion, according to several media reports.

Sri Lanka have won three out of the five stagings of the biennial tournament, while the 2010 final was the only one that did not feature a team from South Asia.Former players and pundits have been united in endorsing India, who won the 50-over World Cup at home in 2011, as favourites to add a second World Twenty20 title to their cabinet and given the side's run of form, it is hardly surprising.Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men have won 10 of the 11 Twenty20 contests they have played this year, including a 3-0 win in Australia, and have looked supremely balanced with their often-soft bowling attack also showing plenty of bite.The only worry for India's fanatical cricket following will be that the team have peaked too early and they will be desperately hoping that the law of averages catches up with them after the final at Kolkata's Eden Gardens on April 3.While India have enjoyed a relatively trouble-free build up to the tournament, it has been far from smooth sailing for fellow Asian contenders Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Pakistan, the 2009 champions, arguably have the most potent pace attack with left-arm fast bowler Mohammad Amir seamlessly integrating into the side after a five-year spot-fixing ban.But Shahid Afridi's men have had troubles with their top-order, prompting the selectors to twice tinker with the squad and a row over security leading to a venue

and encouraging paperless environment at all levels.To ensure maximum participation of members in the decision making process of the company, the Companies Ordinance 2016 encourages use of modern electronic means of communication, he said, adding that it also includes special provisions to facilitate small and medium enterprises.The Companies Ordinance 2016 also includes provisions for Shariah

non-executive directors. \"It encourages non-executive directors inclusion in the board and provisions for the manner of selection and maintenance of data bank of independent directors,\" the ministers said in a statement.It also aims at addressing the issues relating to protection of interest of minority shareholders and creditors.The new ordinance also introduces other reforms such as relaxations for free zone companies\u0092, registration of agricultural promotion companies for the development of agricultural sector and the establishment of Investor Education and Awareness Fund, the finance minister added.It also includes provisions for the registration of valuers dispute resolution mechanism through mediation and conciliation panel, passing of members resolution through

authorities in respect of investment in foreign companies.It also provides facilitation and regulation of the public sector enterprises.Under the new ordinance, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) will maintain Companies Global Register of Beneficial Ownership, which will have complete record of the beneficial ownership of the substantial shareholders and officers in local

and or beneficial owners.Dar said that to ensure adequate measures against fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing, the new ordinance empowers the SECP to investigate and also conduct joint investigations.Further, provisions requiring officers of a company to take adequate measures to curb such violations have also been included.The minister said the Companies Ordinance 2016 has been promulgated to provide relief and incentives to the corporate sector, especially small- and medium-sized companies and to give immediate impetus to the economy and stimulate economic growth.There was

surely not be long before twilight five-day games are a regular feature on the sub-continent.</strongIndia and Pakistan are set to play floodlit tests this year while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are considering following suit pending the results of domestic trials.India\u00b4s all powerful board of control, the BCCI, has traditionally been suspicious of anything new and ensured the world\u00b4s second most populous nation was the last of the major cricketing powers to embrace the Twenty20 format of the game.That embrace has quickly turned into a passionate love affair courtesy of the Indian Premier League (IPL) but the BCCI is still resisting the Decision Review System (DRS) with all its considerable might.It insists it will not accept the technology, which is aimed at reducing umpiring howlers, until it is foolproof.As a result DRS are not used in any bilateral series involving India.The commercial prospects of day-night tests, however, have not been lost on the world\u00b4s richest cricket board and it announced last month it would host a floodlit test against New Zealand when the Black Caps tour later this year.BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur said the controversial pink ball used in such contests would be trialled in the domestic Duleep Trophy to help captain Virat Kohli and his team prepare for the day-nighter.\"There are lots of factors that need to be taken into account.Things like dew factor, how the spinners bowl with the pink Kookaburra (ball) on Indian pitches,\" Thakur said.The dates and venues of the series against New Zealand have yet to be confirmed but Kolkata\u00b4s Eden Gardens has been put forward as a possible venue by Cricket Association of Bengal president and former India captain Sourav Ganguly.\"We want to play host to a pink-ball test in the future,\" said Ganguly.\"We will try to host a local four-day match with the pink ball under the floodlights as a test.\"Turnout for test matches in India generally lags far behind the full houses that can be expected for one-day internationals and some IPL fixtures.Even those in the BCCI suspicious of change, therefore, were enthused by what they saw at Adelaide Oval last November when Australia and New Zealand played out the first floodlit test.strong>PICTURESQUE GROUND</strongThe match only lasted only three days, hence the controversy over the pink ball, but attracted more than 123,000 fans through the gates at the picturesque ground as the hosts clinched the trans-Tasman series.The Adelaide turnout looked even more impressive at a time when the game\u00b4s longest format is grappling with dwindling crowds amid the many burgeoning Twenty20 leagues springing up across the cricketing globe.Even Sri Lanka, who turned down Pakistan\u00b4s proposal to play a day-night test in 2013 citing their inexperience with the pink ball, are now considering the option.\"We are looking at it very positively,\" Sri Lanka Cricket secretary Mohan de Silva told Reuters.\"We are gearing ourselves for the eventuality.The ICC (International Cricket Council) has cleared it and (at some point), we\u00b4d also fall in line.\"The ICC approved day-night tests in 2012 after successful trials of pink balls in Australia, England, Pakistan and South Africa.Pakistan will play a day-night test in Australia in December and might play one before that, against West Indies in October, provided the Caribbean nations agree to the proposal.Another Asian team, Bangladesh, are being a little more cautious about dipping their toes into the water.New Zealand have proposed hosting a day-nighters when Bangladesh visit the country in December and England want to play a twilight test during their tour of the South Asian country in October-November, a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official told

Nobel laureate, to cheers from thousands of residents who succumbed to the excitement of the Games.It was a far cry from the previous evening, when riot police had used stun grenades and tear gas to clear protesters from the torch's path in a poor suburb of Rio, fuelling complaints that the Games have ignored the city's poor.Those anti-torch demonstrations - the second in two days - underscored simmering social tensions in Latin America's largest nation amid its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and a political crisis that has deeply divided the country.That resentment was nowhere to be seen on Thursday as the torch progressed through the well-heeled districts of Barra de Tijuca, where the Games will be held.\"It's impossible to explain the emotion of carrying the

on Friday in the famed Maracana soccer stadium with a ceremony showcasing samba and the drumming made famous by Rio's Carnival celebrations - which will be watched by 50,000 in the arena and an estimated 3 billion around the world by television.The torch rode the waves into Rio on Thursday in the hands of veteran Brazilian surfer Rico de Souza, a day after the International Olympic Committee

We've been waiting for a long time for the Olympics and for surfing to be part of the Games,\" said local surfer Milton Roberto, among hundreds of fans who cheered Souza as he did laps of Macumba beach after carrying the torch out of the ocean.Some 500,000 foreign visitors are descending on the iconic beach city.

The three were released unharmed, authorities said.The opposition has called a demonstration against interim President Michel Temer's government for Friday outside the Maracana stadium, accusing him of conducting a 'coup' against suspended leftist President Dilma Rousseff, who is being placed on trial in the Senate.The tense political atmosphere may have deterred some foreign leaders from attending the Games, with Brazilian presidency sources saying only 28 heads of state have confirmed their presence - around half what was expected last week.French President Francois Hollande, whose country is bidding for the 2024 Games, toured Rio de Janeiro's Olympic Park on Thursday, met with members of his national swim team and posed for photos in front of the Olympic rings.The volatile political situation has added to concerns over crime, water pollution, late infrastructure and an outbreak of the Zika virus in northern Brazil earlier this year that clouded the build-up to the Games.The mayor's office declared holidays on Thursday and Friday to ease persistent problems with traffic.The Olympic soccer competition entered a second day on Thursday with Brazil eking out a disappointing 0-0 draw against South Africa in the national stadium in the capital Brasilia. Soccer is the only sport with games taking place outside the host city.Fans of the national team watched the game in the rehabilitated Pra\u00e7a Mau\u00e1 square by Rio's port, home to a new museum and water-front promenade built for the Games.

It last stood at $1.1031, bouncing back on profit-taking.The yen dipped to 121.60 to the dollar, its lowest since late August as traders speculated the Bank of Japan might unleash additional easing on Friday, before bouncing back to 121.16 on profit-taking.\"The Japanese economy is weaker than in August and there's no sign of a rebound.

Their record has been poor, winning just seven of their 93 Tests and they are currently ranked ninth, just above Zimbabwe.However, performances have improved significantly of late and Bangladesh have only lost six of their last 18 Tests.BCB vice president Mahbubul Anam warned Bangladesh \"would go backwards\" if they stop playing teams such as England and India, both of whom they are due to play later this year. \"The more we play against competitive sides, the better we\u00b4ll get,\" said Anam.Alistair Campbell, a former director of Zimbabwe\u00b4s board, appreciated the arguments for a split because of the gulf in class between the top and bottom sides.But Campbell, a former captain who played in Zimbabwe\u00b4s inaugural Test against India in 1992, said it would be heartbreaking if current players would never be able to compete against the best.\"It\u00b4s going to be a tragedy if you are growing up in a country like Zimbabwe or Bangladesh,\" he told AFP. \"It means you might never get the opportunity to play with top tier sides. That might drive players to go and seek greener pastures.\"There are similar fears in Sri Lanka which has fallen down the rankings in the last two years after batting greats Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene retired.<br/> Sri Lanka are currently ranked seventh and in danger of being overtaken by an improving West Indies by the time the proposed split comes into force.Sri Lanka also struggled in the first decade after their inaugural Test in 1982 but then found their feet and won the 1996 World Cup.Sidath Wettimuny, who scored Sri Lanka\u00b4s first Test century, warned the architects of the split were playing with fire.\"It\u00b4s okay to make some tweaks but what is proposed is going to be a disaster in every sense of the word,\" he said.Sri Lankan board\u00b4s secretary Mohan de Silva was cool on the proposal. \"We are not very much in favour, but we need to discuss with our executive committee after studying it carefully before taking a final decision,\" he wrote in a text from Scotland.But Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera insisted the shake-up should be opposed as it would \"have a negative impact\".Sri Lanka\u00b4s cash-strapped board is hugely dependent on TV money and ticket revenue from tours by the likes of India and Australia. But neither broadcasters nor spectators will pay significant amounts for matches involving minnows such as Ireland.\"If you club the weakest teams in one league, who\u00b4ll be interested in watching those games? This will lead to financial ruin,\" Jayasekera told AFP.The BCB\u00b4s Alam also warned of dire financial consequences. \"There would be an inevitable loss of interest among younger followers of and a decline in interest from the media and sponsors,\" he said.\"The resulting downturn in revenues would undermine development programmes and funding of domestic leagues\u0085.

The 2016 forecast was for a pick-up to 3.8 percent.\"Moderate growth continues, with an improving recovery in advanced economies, and a slowdown in underlying growth in emerging-market and low-income developing economies,\" said Olivier Blanchard, the IMF\u00b4s chief economist, at a news conference.According to the IMF, the downgrade of the global growth forecast largely reflects the contraction in the US economy in the first quarter amid severe winter weather, which spilled over to neighboring Canada and Mexico.\"The unexpected weakness in North America, which accounts for the lion\u00b4s share of the growth forecast revision in advanced economies, is likely to prove a temporary setback,\" it said.Because of the setback, the IMF lowered its forecast for the United States, the world\u00b4s largest economy, by 0.6 percentage point to 2.5 percent. Canada\u00b4s forecast was cut by 0.7 point to 1.5 percent, and Mexico\u00b4s by 0.6 point to 2.4 percent.Blanchard said that the US economy\u00b4s soft first quarter, a 0.2 percent contraction, turned out to not be a sign of underlying weakness \"now that the fog has largely cleared.\"\"Fundamentals are still solid, and the US recovery is on track,\" he said.Greece\u00b4s debt crisis, which could force it to abandon the euro, for the moment only was having a marginal effect on the expansion of the global economy, the IMF said in the update of its World Economic Outlook.The institution left unchanged its forecasts for the eurozone at 1.5 percent, and for the two largest economies: Germany (1.6 percent) and France (1.2 percent).\"Developments in Greece have, so far, not resulted in any significant contagion. Timely policy action should help to manage such risks if they were to materialize,\" it said, noting the recovery in the eurozone seemed \"broadly on track\".But the recent rise in interest rates on the sovereign bonds in some euro area economies could signal larger problems ahead. \"Some risks of a reemergence of financial stress remain,\" it said.- China outlook unchanged -The 188-nation IMF also left unchanged its forecast for China (6.8 percent) despite the turbulence in its capital markets.\"The puncture of what had clearly become a stock market bubble may have some limited effect on spending. But, for the moment, the slowdown in growth is primarily led by a slowdown in real estate investment, a development we see as basically desirable,\" Blanchard said.\"There is no particular reason to have lost confidence\" in China\u00b4s economy because of the bursting bubble, he added.Japan, the world\u00b4s number-three economy, had some drag from sluggish consumption and wage growth, the IMF said, lowering its forecast by 0.2 point to 0.8 percent.Slowing growth in emerging market and developing economies was also holding back momentum in the global economy.The IMF said the contraction in Brazil, Latin America\u00b4s largest economy, would be worse than previously thought; it expects the economy to shrink by 1.5 percent this year.But the outlook for Russia, also in recession, was improved, with a 3.4 percent contraction expected after improvements in commodity prices and confidence.Risks to growth remained tilted to the downside, it said, including spillovers to economic activity from heightened geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa.Given these uncertainties, the IMF was waiting for better growth in 2016, estimated at 3.8 percent, but showed caution.\"The projected pickup in global growth, while still expected, has not yet firmly materialized,\" it said.", "label": 0}, "external-85": {"text": "strong>LAHORE: Pakistani real estate giant Rafi Group made a ten-fold profit last year from its sale of hundreds of acres of land in the remote fishing town of Gwadar, acquired soon after the government announced plans for a deep-sea port there.</strongThe windfall came after 12 years of waiting patiently for the Gwadar port to emerge as the centrepiece of China's ambitious plans for a trade and energy corridor stretching from the Persian Gulf, across Pakistan, into western Xinjiang.\"We had anticipated the Chinese would need a route to the Arabian Sea,\" Rafi Group Chief Executive Shehriar Rafi told Reuters. \"And today, all routes lead back to Gwadar.\"Gwadar forms the southern Pakistan hub of a $57-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) of infrastructure and energy projects Beijing announced in 2014.Since then, land prices have skyrocketed as property demand has spiked, and dozens of real estate firms want to cash in.\"Gwadar is a 'Made in China' brand and everyone wants a piece,\" said realtor Afzal Adil, one of several who shifted operations from the eastern city of Lahore in 2015.Last year, Pakistan welcomed the first large shipment of Chinese goods at Gwadar, where the China Overseas Ports Holding Company Ltd took over operations in 2013. It plans to eventually handle 300 million to 400 million tons of cargo a year.It also aims to develop seafood processing plants in a nearby free trade zone sprawled over 923 hectares (2,281 acres).The route through Gwadar offers China its shortest path to the oil-rich Middle East, Africa, and most of the Western hemisphere, besides promising to open up remote, landlocked Xinjiang.Last year, the Applied Economics Research Centre estimated the corridor would create 700,000 jobs in Pakistan and a Chinese newspaper recently put the number at more than 2 million.Authorities have completed an expressway through Gwadar, which has a 350-km (218-mile) road network. A new international airport kicks off next year, to handle an influx of hundreds of Chinese traders and officials expected to live near the port.The volume of Gwadar property searches surged 14-fold on Pakistan's largest real estate database, Zameen.com, between 2014 and 2016, up from a prior rate of a few hundred a month.\"It's like a gold rush,\" said Chief Executive Zeeshan Ali Khan. \"Anyone who is interested in real estate, be it an investor or a developer, is eyeing Gwadar.\"Prices, which have risen two- to four-fold on average, are climbing \"on a weekly basis,\" said Saad Arshed, the Pakistan managing director of online real estate marketplace Lamudi.pk.Regional fishermen have held strikes during the last two years, to protest against being displaced by the port.To keep pace with the interest, urban officials are struggling to computerise land management and record-keeping. \"We are trying to upgrade as fast as we can,\" said Zakir Majeed, an official of the Gwadar Development Authority (GDA).But Gwadar lacks basic education and health facilities, in contrast to the gleaming towers and piped drinking water of the \"smart city\" envisioned by the GDA.\"For commercial projects, things are moving fast,\" Lamudi's Arshed said. \"But people actually living there, that will take a long time.\"Port officials expect the population to hit 2 million over the next two decades, from about 185,000 now.strong>RISK</strongThe government commissioned work on the Gwadar port in 2002, but development was held up by chronic instability in the surrounding resource-rich province of Baluchistan, where ethnic separatist rebels have chafed against a military crackdown.Since China announced the corridor plan in 2014, security has improved, with Pakistan setting up a new army division to ensure protection, while hundreds of rebels surrendered arms.Real estate firms dismiss fears the \"Gwadar bubble\" might still burst, pointing to China's enduring interest.\"The risk is always there,\" Rafi said. \"But our confidence comes from knowing this is not a Pakistani initiative, but a Chinese city on the Arabian Sea coast.

West Texas Intermediate for August delivery gained 84 cents at $53.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.European benchmark Brent oil for August delivery added 66 cents at $58.51 a barrel in London. \"I think people had already sold down the price of oil, expecting an agreement,\" said Michael Lynch, an analyst with the US-based consultancy Strategic Energy & Economic Research. \"So it\u00b4s a case of selling on the rumour and buying on the news.\"\"Now that it\u00b4s actually happened, people are buying back in,\" Lynch said.Analysts said the landmark agreement that will see sanctions eventually lifted on Iran\u00b4s oil exports would help to put a lid on any rise in crude futures this year and in the future.\"To be clear, the return of Iranian oil exports over the next year is one factor likely to keep oil prices low,\" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at consultants Capital Economics.Historic dealMajor powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- clinched a historic deal Tuesday aimed at ensuring Iran does not obtain the nuclear bomb, opening up Tehran\u00b4s stricken economy and potentially ending decades of bad blood with the West.Reached on day 18 of marathon talks in Vienna, the accord is aimed at resolving a 13-year standoff over Iran\u00b4s nuclear ambitions after repeated diplomatic failures and threats of military action.The deal puts strict limits on Iran\u00b4s nuclear activities for at least a decade and calls for stringent UN oversight, with world powers hoping that this will make any dash to make an atomic bomb virtually impossible.In return, painful international sanctions that have slashed the oil exports of OPEC\u00b4s fifth-largest producer and choked its economy will be lifted and billions of dollars in frozen assets unblocked.However, analysts cautioned that it will take time for additional Iranian oil to hit markets.\"Iranian crude oil production is likely to increase in 2016 but will take a number of years to reach its previous peak,\" Fitch Ratings said in a client note on Tuesday.\"Iran\u00b4s oil exports at the moment are around 1.1 million barrels per day versus levels of around 2.5 million before 2012,\" it noted.The ratings agency added: \"We would expect to see some increases in production throughout the course of 2016 but that this would be less than half of the full 1.4 million barrels daily that was lost.\"The remainder will require significant investment and expertise, for which Iran is likely to want to partner with international oil companies.\"A spokesperson for Royal Dutch Shell said the energy giant is \"interested in exploring the role Shell can play in developing Iran\u00b4s energy potential\".BP added in a statement: \"We are watching the situation and in the meantime we continue to comply with sanctions.

Pessimism about prospects for an agreement sent oil prices lower on Friday.In September the cartel agreed in principle to lower production to 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day (bpd), meaning a cut of between 600,000 and 1.1 million bpd.This, OPEC\u00b4s 14 members hope, will reduce the mammoth global supply glut and so increase the market price of oil from its current painful level of below $50 a barrel.It also marks a reversal of OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia\u00b4s two-year-old strategy of flooding the market to squeeze out rivals, in particular US shale oil producers.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who was due in Vienna for the talks with other OPEC ministers, said this month an agreement was \"imperative\".strong>- Devil in the detail -</strongBut it remains to be agreed what size cuts, if any, each of OPEC\u00b4s members will make, particularly Iraq and Iran, the cartel\u00b4s next-biggest producers after Riyadh.Strife-torn Libya on Sunday ruled itself out of any cuts, arguing that it was in \"such a dangerous economic situation\" that there was no way it could take part.Iraq has said it will cut output but that it is short of money needed to fight Islamic State extremists. It also disputes with OPEC the level of its current output.Iran, newly free of export restrictions since last year\u00b4s nuclear deal, says it won\u00b4t cut production until it has reached pre-sanctions levels.Adding to the difficulties is the fierce rivalry between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia, engaged in a proxy war in Yemen and backing different sides in Syria.strong>- Russia on board? -</strongAs the meeting has approached, OPEC members turned their sights on non-cartel producers, particularly Russia, for a pledge they would also tighten the taps.Securing a commitment from non-OPEC nations is important because the cartel only produces about a third of the world\u00b4s oil, meaning its ability to influence prices is limited.Algeria\u00b4s oil minister said in Iran this weekend that OPEC is prepared to cut production by 1.1 million bpd if non-members reduce by 600,000 bpd, local media reported.President Vladimir Putin said last week Russia was ready to \"freeze production\", but stopped short of promising a cut.Russia, its finances hit by low oil prices and Western sanctions, is pumping some 11 million bpd, more even than Saudi Arabia and at levels not seen since Soviet days.In a sign of ongoing tensions, Saudi Arabia pulled out of talks due Monday with non-OPEC producers including Russia ahead of the Vienna meeting, Bloomberg News reported.The news agency said Sunday that Algeria and Venezuela\u00b4s oil ministers would travel to Moscow on Monday to try to get Russia on board.strong>- Prices at the pump -</strongIf OPEC does manage to get a deal and oil prices rise -- though the increase may be modest -- then this will hit the wallets of billions of consumers worldwide.But higher oil prices might actually help the global economy, according to research by Goldman Sachs published by Bloomberg.This is because richer oil producers would then pump more liquidity into the global financial system.Low oil prices have blown a massive hole in producers\u00b4 finances in recent years, hurting not just more vulnerable OPEC members like Venezuela and Nigeria but even the Gulf states.Saudi Arabia, once seen as fabulously wealthy, is projecting a budget deficit of $87 billion in 2016.

It was 3.75 percent in June 2015 and 4.25 percent four years ago.The Fed is expected to leave its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged following its two-day meeting on Wednesday, according to a Reuters poll of economists.The Fed's policy rate has been about 0.38 percent since it was raised in December, the first increase in nearly a decade.The expected reduction in the longer-run neutral rate forecast amounts to a lower speed limit on future rate hikes, and points to fewer increases with longer gaps between them than U.S. central bankers and investors had expected.The lower the neutral rate forecast, the less anxious the Fed needs to be about tightening policy, which would justify its repeated decisions to defer rate increases.The result, says San Francisco Fed President John Williams, will be the \"shallowest\" set of rate hikes ever; \"much flatter,\" according to Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan in a separate conversation, than anything in the past.The Fed has not raised rates this year despite signaling in December that four rate hikes were coming in 2016. That number has since been scaled back to two hikes this year, with another three hikes in 2017, due to a global growth slowdown, financial market volatility and tepid U.S. inflation.But given the new thinking on the neutral rate, that seems overly optimistic.Fed policymakers say an aging U.S. population and decline in productivity growth is sapping economic potential, making them wary about raising rates too fast.\"They are not very far from being in a tightening mode,\" said Shehriyar Antia, founder of Macro Insight Group and a former senior analyst at the New York Fed. \"That augers for more patience since the risk of you falling behind with inflation is less because it ain't going to take that much for rates to lean on inflation.\"FED TOOLBOXRegardless of any reduction in the neutral rate estimate this week, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is likely to stick with her view that the central bank's so-called toolbox - its more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, low interest rates and planned gradual removal of stimulus - is appropriate for an economy that has consistently fallen short of growth forecasts.During the global central banking conference last month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellen said that policy mix had served the Fed well and would likely be useful in the face of a future economic downturn.But the Fed's constant walk-backs have served to undercut some of the market's faith in the central bank. Traders of short-term rate futures, for instance, are now betting the Fed will not hike rates until early next year.Still, any cut to the Fed's neutral rate forecast does not mean it will never raise rates.\"They want to maintain market expectations for a rate hike in case they want to raise rates in December if conditions warrant one,\" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.The Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday and Yellen will hold a press conference shortly after.

It's at standstill. There is uncertainty that, God forbid, if war breaks out, what will happen?\" said Ihsanul Haq, chairman of the Pakistan Cotton Dealers Association.Pakistan Cotton Commissioner Khalid Abdullah said a \"low quantum of trade activity is still taking place.\"He said the Pakistan government had not directed traders to stop buying Indian cotton and expected trade to normalize when tensions eased.Indian government officials said they had not yet noticed trading had stopped.But some Indian officials said last week that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government was considering whether it should choke trade with Pakistan to put pressure on its neighbour, even though the trade balance is in India's favour.strong>INDIA'S BIGGEST COTTON BUYER</strongTrade between India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars since their independence from British rule in 1947, is small.In the 2015/16 fiscal year ending on March 31, official trade between the two was $2.6 billion. Cotton is the largest component of that total.It is not clear whether other goods and commodities traded between the two, such as jewellery and dry fruits, have been hit by the escalation in hostilities as well, but the disruption to cotton shipments is potentially significant.In the crop year ended Sept. 30, Pakistan was India's biggest cotton buyer after its own crop was hit by drought and whitefly pest.It imported 2.5 million bales from India, and supported Indian cotton prices at a time when China was cutting imports, traders said.Lower purchases by Pakistan this year could hurt exports from the world's biggest producer of the fibre and put pressure on Indian prices, but could also help rival cotton suppliers like Brazil, the United States and some African countries.Chirag Patel, chief executive officer of Indian exporter Jaydeep Cotton Fibers, said the country could export 5 million bales in the 2016/17 crop year, but exports could plunge to 3 million bales without Pakistani imports.An exporter based in Mumbai estimated that Pakistan will need to import at least 3 million bales in 2016/17, and India will have a surplus of around 8 million bales.\"As soon as the (political) situation improves, cotton trade will definitely resume between the two countries,\" said Haq of the Pakistan Cotton Dealers Association.But for now, traders on both sides of the border said the environment was not conducive to doing business.\"Many cotton exporters are not interested in selling cotton to Pakistan. They are trying to find other markets,\" said Pradeep Jain, a ginner based in Jalgaon in the western state of Maharashtra.Shahzad Ali Khan, chairman of Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association, referred to a move by the Indian Motion Picture Producers' Association (IMPPA), a small filmmakers' body, last week, banning their members from hiring Pakistani actors.\"India is banning Pakistani artists, so how can it expect us to buy cotton from India?\" Khan said.\"In various forums Pakistani traders are saying they will not buy cotton from India this year. Even if they need to pay extra, they will pay and buy it from other suppliers.\"", "label": 0}, "external-103": {"text": "Hong Kong: Asian markets extended their rally this week, while the euro dipped ahead of a much-anticipated European Central Bank policy meeting that is forecast to see it introduce more monetary easing measures.Tokyo added 0.28 percent, or 48.54 points, to end at 17,329.02, Sydney rose 0.49 percent, or 26.56 points, to 5,419.94 and Seoul was flat, dipping a marginal 0.41 points to 1,920.82.Hong Kong rose 0.70 percent, or 170.05 points, to 24,522.63 and Shanghai gained 0.59 percent, or 19.73 points, to 3,343.34.

The International Energy Agency meanwhile forecast that global oil demand growth would slow in 2016 and that oil production in nations outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would stall.In its first estimates for 2016, the IEA forecast that oil demand would slow next year to 1.2 million barrels per day, compared with an average of 1.4 million barrels per day this year.Meanwhile growth in non-OPEC oil supply \"is expected to grind to a halt in 2016 as lower oil prices and spending cuts take a toll\", the IEA said in its monthly oil report.In trading Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in August climbed 42 cents to $53.20 a barrel compared with Thursday\u00b4s close.Brent North Sea crude for August advanced 62 cents to stand at $59.23 a barrel in London afternoon deals.- Chinese turbulence -US crude futures had sunk nearly eight percent Monday on worries about slowing global growth, as Greek voters rejected a bailout offer and China moved to calm financial market turbulence.\"There are some signs that foreign investors are more optimistic about China\u00b4s efforts to arrest the stock slide,\" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets.\"However, I feel much caution should be exercised and it is important to observe the Chinese markets in the coming sessions before calling it a bottom.\"Aw added: \"As we have seen in the past, Chinese equities may recover in one session, only to fall straight back into a downward spiral the next day.\"Chinese stocks surged for a second day on Friday as a government rescue plan offered a respite from a month-long rout.In a rollercoaster week, the Shanghai market gained 5.18 percent overall, after the government announced additional policies to avoid a market crash.But it is still down 24.9 percent from its closing peak on June 12.

Svensson for his work on monetary policy./><strong>- \u00b4Time for a woman\u00b4 -</strong\u00a0Still more Americans have been named as possible winners: Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig for their work on financial panic models, or Robert Townsend for his work on risk and insurance in developing economies.Michael Woodford, a monetary theorist currently teaching at Columbia University, and Robert Barro, who researches the factors that determine economic growth, are also mentioned as serious candidates.Women remain largely absent from the list of economics laureates. Only one woman has won the prize -- Elinor Ostrom, in 2009.But French-American Esther Duflo, 43, would be an ideal laureate, according to economist Micael Dahlen, interviewed in Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet.\"It\u00b4s high time for a woman to get the prize, for someone under the age of retirement to get it, and because her research is groundbreaking in the fields of poverty and economics, among other things,\" he said.The economics prize is the fifth of the six Nobel prizes to be announced this year.Last week, the awards for medicine, physics, and chemistry were announced, as well as the peace prize, which went to Colombia\u00b4s President Juan Manuel Santos for his efforts to end a half-century war with the FARC rebels.The final prize, for literature, will be announced Thursday.For that award, the Swedish Academy could tap a superstar novelist such as Philip Roth of the US or Haruki Murakami of Japan, or a lesser-known writer such as Norwegian playwright Jon Fosse or Syrian poet Adonis.The Nobel prize consists of a diploma, a gold medal and cheque for eight million Swedish kronor (828,000 euros, $928,000), which the laureates will receive at a ceremony in Stockholm on December 10.", "label": 0}, "external-106": {"text": "Hong Kong: Asian markets mostly wound back Thursday, in line with a hefty sell-off on Wall Street, after surprisingly weak US data hinted at ongoing weakness in the world\u00b4s number one economy.The euro broke above $1.10, boosted by receding expectations of an early US rate hike and upbeat indicators out of the eurozone.Oil prices also enjoyed support from concerns about unrest in the crude-rich Middle East following news that Saudi jets had struck rebel positions in neighbouring Yemen.Tokyo tumbled 1.39 percent, or 275.08 points, to 19,471.12 after earlier this week touching a 15-year high, while Sydney sank 1.58 percent, or 94.22 points, to close at 5,879.1 and Seoul fell 0.99 percent, or 20.25 points, to 2,022.56.Hong Kong lost 0.13 percent, dropping 31.15 points to 24,497.08 but Shanghai gained 0.58 percent, or 21.37 points, to 3,682.10, having fallen Wednesday for the first time in 11 sessions.US investors ran for the sidelines Wednesday after the Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell in February after January\u00b4s gain.While the news will likely put back the Federal Reserve\u00b4s timeline on when to raise interest rates, it was taken Wednesday by investors as a sign of weakness, fuelling fears about the global outlook.The Nasdaq fell 2.37 percent, the Dow tumbled 1.62 percent and the S&P 500 gave up 1.46 percent.\"Wall Street is struggling to add to its recent record high and it looks like the upward momentum is starting to show signs of fatigue,\" Matthew Sherwood, head of investment markets research in Sydney at Perpetual Ltd., told Bloomberg News.\"Asia has an advantage over the US as Asia has cheaper valuations.

But Amir struck with his 14th ball back in first-class cricket on English soil.Left-hander Trescothick, on eight, could only edge a superb outswinger that moved late and wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed held an excellent diving catch.Amir had another wicket when a full-length inswinger bowled first-class debutant Adam Hose (10).And eight minutes after lunch, Amir bowled Peter Trego (23) with another fine inswinger that knocked over the batsman\u00b4s middle stump and left the other two standing.\"He bowled very well,\" said the 40-year-old Trescothick, whose nine-balls faced on Monday were all bowled by Amir, after stumps.\"He swung the ball really late, that\u00b4s the biggest thing we noticed.<br/>\"In my \u00b4magnificent\u00b4 eight I thought it was pretty hard work, it was tricky,\" added Trescothick, who in 76 Tests from 2000-2006 scored 5,825 runs at an average of nearly 44 with 14 hundreds./><strong>\u00b4Guessing\u00b4</strong\"You get a lot of bowlers who swing it quite early but he (Amir) was swinging it late and as it was coming down the pitch you were almost guessing whether it was an inswinger or whether it was one of the straight ones,\" the Somerset stalwart explained.Trescothick was in no doubt that, on this form, Amir could threaten England\u00b4s current top order.\"On that performance yes he will cause problems for England. \"He got Adam Hose with a good inswinger round the wicket and Pete Trego got an absolute beauty.\"That bit of extra pace is the thing. He hasn\u00b4t played international cricket for a number of years so there\u00b4s probably an extra bit of zip that he has that makes him hard work.\"Despite suggestions from England captain Alastair Cook that spectators might jeer Amir, there was nothing but polite applause as he came on to bowl in Taunton.\"I don\u00b4t think you\u00b4d expect anything else,\" said Trescothick. \"We get on and play the game and it is what it is.\"Meanwhile Pakistan opener Shan Masood said of Amir: \"He hasn\u00b4t lost it.

These things happen not just in football but in life, and the best thing would be no corruption anywhere.\"In terms of individual achievement, Ronaldo had slightly the better in the last year, scoring 54 goals in 52 games for Real Madrid, compared to Messi's 48 in 53.", "label": 0}, "external-109": {"text": "LEEDS: England took command on the second afternoon of the first Test at Headingley after Jonny Bairstow played \u00a0a brilliant counter-punching innings of 140 and later added three catches behind the stumps. With a total of 298 to defend, Stuart Broad and James Anderson produced another classy display of seam and swing bowling to leave the Sri Lankans rattled on 43 for 3 at tea.It was a situation far removed from the 83-for-5 scoreline that had confronted Bairstow when he walked out to bat shortly after lunch on the first day. And with the new ball jagging alarmingly from a full length as Broad and Anderson brought all of their huge experience to bear, it took a gutsy response from Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lanka's most experienced pairing, to reach the break without further damage.Faced with grey skies and a packed cordon, Sri Lanka's openers, Dimuth Karunaratne and Kaushal Silva betrayed their anxieties in the very first over, when they hesitated so long over a quick single that they could have ended up shaking hands in the middle of the pitch.Instead, they simply waved goodbye in the space of five deliveries as, first, Broad straightened one off the seam to kiss the edge of the left-handed Karunaratne, who departed for a 12-ball duck, before Anderson drew level with Kapil Dev on 434 career wickets by finding some extra lift to dispose of Silva for 11.One over later, and Broad had two wickets in three balls as he went wide on the crease to spear an angled full-length ball into Kusal Mendis' forward defence, for Bairstow to snaffle the slenderest of deflections behind the stumps.Chandimal and Mathews, however, stood firm in a 31-run stand before the interval.The story of the day, however, remained Bairstow's happy homecoming - a second Test century and his first at his Yorkshire home. Continuing the theme that Bairstow and his fellow not-out batsman, Alex Hales, had established on the first afternoon, England's sixth-wicket pair extended their stand to 141 to banish the memories of the top-order wobble, when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs.At the other end, Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century. But he faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack, Hales' patience snapped for good. In Herath's second over, he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers. A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover, who pouched the offering with a well-judged dive.If Hales' failing had been to linger too long, then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali. England's No. 8 had admitted before the match that he had lost a bit of confidence in being slated to come in so low for his country, but the hasty manner in which he came and went didn't exactly enhance his case for a promotion. He had failed to score from his first seven deliveries when he drove too firmly at his eighth, from Chameera, and lobbed a simple catch off the inside edge and pad, to Mendis under the helmet at short leg.It was a timely reward for the slippery Chameera, bowling only his second over of the day. He had erred on the short side in his fruitless first day's work, but was soon celebrating two wickets in the space of five deliveries when Broad drove flat-footedly at a hint of width outside off and spread-eagled his own stumps via an inside edge.Bairstow simply stared down the track, rather nonplussed by the clatter of wickets in his midst. But he didn't have to wait long to reframe the story of the session. From the first ball of Chameera's next over, Bairstow drilled a drive into the covers, paused as a wild shy came in at the non-striker's end, then galloped through with glee as the ball zipped through for overthrows to gift him his second century and his first on home soil.", "label": 0}, "external-110": {"text": "strong>Birmingham: Mickey Arthur said Friday that winning series away from their adopted UAE home would be Pakistan\u00b4s acid test after former side Australia\u00b4s struggles in Sri Lanka bolstered their hopes of becoming the world\u00b4s number one Test team.</strongPakistan are currently third in the International Cricket Council standings, with Australia on top.But they could rise to the summit if Australia lose their ongoing series in Sri Lanka and Pakistan themselves triumph in England.The first part of that equation moved nearer to reality Friday when Australia, already 1-0 down in a three-match campaign, were left staring at defeat on an extraordinary second day of the second Test in Galle at 25 for three chasing a mammoth 413 for victory.Pakistan, all square at 1-1 in a four-match series with England, had a better, if frustrating, time on Friday\u00b4s third day of the third Test at Edgbaston.Having established a first-innings lead of 103, they saw England captain Alastair Cook (64 not out) and Alex Hales (50 not out) erase the deficit with an unbroken opening stand of 120 that left the hosts 17 runs in front at stumps.For Pakistan coach Arthur, dramatically sacked by Australia on the eve of the 2013 Ashes series in England, events in Galle had not gone unnoticed.\"Misbah (Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq) and I did chat about it on the bus as we saw the Australian score from Sri Lanka,\" Arthur told reporters after stumps at Edgbaston.\"I think the reality is if you want to be number one in the world you\u00b4ve got to be able to win away from home.\"We\u00b4ve got a tough schedule -- England here, then New Zealand away in two Tests in November and then we go and play in Australia, Boxing Day (Melbourne), the New Year (Sydney) and the night Test in Brisbane.\"But for us to be where we want to be, those are the series we\u00b4ve got to win.\"/><strong>\u00a0Sohail concern</strong> Arthur, who made his international reputation as coach of his native South Africa, lamented a lack of support for left-arm quick Mohammad Amir and leg-spinner Yasir Shah on Friday.Sohail Khan, who Arthur said was prone to inaccuracy along with fellow seamer Rahat Ali because their front arm fell away or was \"lost\" in delivery, marked his first Test in five years with an impressive five for 96 in England\u00b4s first innings 297 at Edgbaston.But he tired markedly in a return of none for 40 in eight overs on Friday.<br/>\"It is a real concern,\" said Arthur.\"He\u00b4s got to back up.

Elijah Mohammad preached a version that denounced white oppression and opposed integration of the races.Ali came to be widely revered, but there was a time when he was rejected, mostly by whites by also by some black leaders for his bold statements against white supremacy and for his refusal to embrace the model epitomized by Martin Luther King, a Christian.\"The sanitizing of Ali's image in recent years has led many to forget that he was reviled by many during the 1960s for his conversion to Islam and for his refusal to be inducted into the U.S. armed forces,\" said Frank Guridy, a visiting associate professor of history at Columbia University.\"He was seen as a traitor to the United States of America.\"In the 1970s, Ali converted to Sunni Islam, the largest denomination among Muslims worldwide, and embraced Sufism, a mystical school of the faith.At the gathering of Muslim-American leaders in Washington, speaker after speaker remembered him fondly as the Muslim who Americans came to love.Ali defended Muslims last December, after Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump proposed temporarily stopping Muslims from entering the country in the wake of militant attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California.\"Our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam, and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people's views on what Islam really is,\" Ali said in a statement.He also used his influence to advocate the release of Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter who spent 18 months in a Iranian prison, and for Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter who was captured by extremists in Pakistan and later beheaded in 2002.\"Muhammad Ali was a gift from God,\" said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, \"not only to Muslims but to the world.\"", "label": 0}, "external-113": {"text": "strong>WASHINGTON: A new World Bank report has praised Pakistan continuing progress in restoring macroeconomic stability, saying it was ready to support the government\u0092s reforms agenda to help spread its benefits more widely.</strong\u0093After achieving macroeconomic stability, the government continued to deliver on its structural reform agenda in FY16, but much remains to be done if growth is to be strengthened and sustained,\u0094 the report said.The \u0093Pakistan Development Update\u0094 report which is released twice a year, noted 4.7 economic growth in 2015-16 financial year, being the highest in eight years and projected the growth to accelerate to 5.4 percent in FY18, according to a statement issued here.

The report warned that Pakistan\u0092s low rates of investment and declining export competitiveness, however, remain a concern.The report said that growth acceleration will depend on the implementation of structural reforms, such as energy and taxation and implementation of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).In the long term, growth will be driven by increased investment in both physical and human capital, with increased focus on better nutrition, health and education outcomes.\u0093Pakistan has made significant progress in reducing poverty over the last decade. Based on the revised poverty line adopted in early 2016, the percentage of people living below the poverty line decreased from 64.3 percent in FY02 to 29.5 percent in FY14,\u0094 the report said. \u0093This reduction in poverty is corroborated when analyzing other data, such as asset ownership\u0094, says Muhammad Waheed, Senior Economist and lead author of the report.Projected even higher growth in FY18, the report also expects a moderate increase in investment (related to CPEC projects) will to contribute to an acceleration of growth, which will continue to be driven by public and private consumption.Pakistan\u0092s growth in FY16 was driven by strong domestic demand.Consumption accounted for an overwhelming 92 percent of GDP in FY16, and contributed 7 percentage points towards GDP growth, supported by sustained growth in remittances.Strong aggregate demand and improving business sentiments were evident in private sector credit growth of 12 percent, expanding by Rs. 461 billion in FY16 compared with Rs. 224 billion in FY15, the report said. Low inflation and low interest rates also contributed to higher credit growth.\u0093The government\u0092s efforts to stabilize the macroeconomic environment provided a better footing for economic activity, while marginal improvements in energy supplies facilitated manufacturing growth in particular,\u0094 the report added.The World Bank\u0092s 2017 Doing Business report found that Pakistan improved four ranks in 2017, placing it among the top ten \u0093most improved\u0094 countries. Revenue growth is underpinning the falling deficit, driven in FY16 by a 20 percent increase in the Federal Board of Revenue\u0092s (FBR) collection.A series of new tax measures in the FY17 budget will broaden the tax base and are expected to contribute to another significant increase in FBR revenues. On the expenditure side, the development budget has grown faster than the recurrent budget.In the FY17 budget, an expected reduction in state-owned enterprise subsidies and interest payments has created space for an increase in infrastructure spending, including on CPEC projects.", "label": 0}, "external-114": {"text": "strong>LONDON: From computers and cars to carpets and food,

third hundred and impressive fast bowling from Shannon Gabriel propelled the West Indies to a comprehensive 100-run victory over South Africa in the ninth and final preliminary match of the Tri-Nation One-Day International Series at Kensington Oval in Barbados on Friday.Bravo\u00b4s stroke-filled 102 anchored an impressive recovery from 21 for four to lift the West Indies to 285 all out off 49.5 overs batting first.Gabriel, in just his second ODI, then tore through the Proteas\u00b4 vaunted top-order, taking the wickets of Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis and captain A.B. de Villiers in the space of four fearsome overs.It was a setback from which they never recovered, eventually being dismissed for 186 off 46 overs despite a last-wicket partnership of 51 between Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir. Sunil Narine ensured there would be no escape for the South Africans after Gabriel\u00b4s early blast, the spinner taking three for 28 off ten overs.With their second win in three matches against the Proteas in the tournament, the hosts advance to face World Cup-holders Australia in the final on Sunday at the same venue. It is also the first time in ten years that South Africa have failed to reach the final of a tri-nation ODI series.Of concern for the West Indies looking ahead to the final though will be the fitness of Gabriel, who left the field nursing a right leg injury after claiming the impressive figures of three for 17 from five overs of extreme pace. He should have also snared the wicket of Hashim Amla but wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin missed the straightforward opportunity offered by the prolific opener.West Indies were themselves rocked back at 21 for four when pacer Kagiso Rabada led the assault after de Villiers chose to field. However Bravo\u00b4s third one-day century, embellished with 12 fours and four sixes off 103 deliveries, proved invaluable. He found an able partner in Kieron Pollard, who curbed his usual all-out aggression in compiling 62 off 71 balls.Their fifth-wicket stand of 156 was a new West Indian record for the wicket against South Africa and wrested the initiative from the visitors who did not help their cause with characteristically untidy cricket in the field, fast-medium bowler Morne Morkel delivering six of the 17 wides conceded by the Proteas.Morkel\u00b4s nine overs cost 68 runs yet for all that indiscipline, he should have still claimed the important wicket early on of Bravo who, on 11, top-edged an attempted hook only for Wayne Parnell to misjudge the catch at fine-leg and parry the ball over the boundary rope.Imran Tahir, who routed the West Indies in their last meeting in St Kitts with record-breaking figures of seven for 45, was kept wicketless through his ten overs for the first time in ODI cricket against these opponents.South Africa\u00b4s bowling star without doubt was Rabada, whose returns of three for 31 were highlighted by a devastating opening burst after Parnell had removed Andre Fletcher in his opening over.Generating tremendous pace, Rabada induced an edge from the other opener, Johnson Charles, for Chris Morris to take a comfortable catch at second slip. He then uprooted Marlon Samuels\u00b4 off-stump first ball to have the West Indies tottering at 12 for three.Ramdin avoided the hat-trick but subsequently succumbed to the lethal hostility of the 21-year-old fast bowler, first ducking into a short ball to take a blow on the back of the helmet before being comprehensively bowled off the next delivery.Bravo and Pollard then countered the rampant South Africans with determination and forceful strokeplay before the big-hitting all-rounder was caught at long-on off the suffering Morkel.Morris claimed three wickets at the end of the innings with West Indies captain Jason Holder (40) and Carlos Brathwaite (33 not out) pushing the home side to a challenging final total.", "label": 0}, "external-117": {"text": "SHANGHAI: Shanghai stocks tumbled on Tuesday, extending the worst daily plunge for eight years after worries about China's faltering economy sent world financial markets reeling, but other Asian markets bounced back from heavy early losses.A slump in Chinese shares sparked panic across global markets on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York initially diving more than 1,000 points, or six percent, before trimming its losses, while European stocks fell sharply.The dollar and commodity prices plumbed fresh multi-year lows in New York, with US oil finishing below $40 a barrel for the first time in six years as fears of a global slowdown hit commodity markets.But Asian bourses cast off heavy early falls Tuesday to post gains by late morning, with Tokyo up 1.10 percent by the break after closing at a six-month low in the previous session.Hong Kong was 1.62 percent higher by the break while Sydney added 2.30 percent, Seoul climbed 1.32 percent and oil led a recovery among commodities as dealers took a breather after Monday\u00b4s rout.\"Our bottom line is that the world\u00b4s still not a bad place,\" David McDonald of Credit Suisse told Bloomberg News.\"It's just a case of whether you would want to rush in now or perhaps wait until it settles down a bit more.\"China's benchmark index in Shanghai opened down 6.41 percent before recovering slightly to stand 4.33 percent off by the break.Slowing growth in Asia's largest economy has long kept investors on edge but China's shock devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago, following a string of weak economic data, has riled world markets.Fears Beijing could taper a massive share market rescue package helped push Shanghai down 8.49 percent on Monday, wiping out the year's gains in its biggest daily slump since February 2007. Capital Economics said investors had been \"overreacting about economic risks in China\", arguing that the \"collapse of the equity bubble tells us next to nothing about the state of China's economy\".'Step up'Chinese shares have been on a roller-coaster ride after a year-long debt-fuelled rally collapsed in mid-June, prompting the government to unleash a vast support package that has included using state vehicles to support the market.In the latest move, Beijing said on Sunday it would allow the state pension fund, which had 3.5 trillion yuan of assets at the end of 2014, to buy stocks.But mainland investors are worried that support could start to taper and they are now waiting to see if the \"national team\" will intervene further, or China\u00b4s central bank will loosen monetary policy.The People\u00b4s Bank of China, the central bank, said on Tuesday it had injected 150 billion yuan ($23 billion) into the money market to ease tight liquidity. \"With such an unreasonable sell-off, they (regulators) should at least encourage the market and step up,\" Haitong Securities analyst Zhang Qi told AFP.

Investors are also unsettled by Trump\u00b4s seeming embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a sign he may take foreign policy in radical new directions.Signs of nervousness have been seen in certain trades, analysts say, like the Mexican peso. Trump\u00b4s pledge of immigration controls and trade restrictions with Mexico have raised worries over its economy.The peso sank against the dollar as Trump\u00b4s campaign added momentum, but then rebounded on Clinton\u00b4s gains following the first presidential debate on September 26.But it remains down about 9 percent since Trump secured his party\u00b4s nomination in May.On the other hand, another gauge of market sentiment has been the biotechnology sector, which is seen as vulnerable in a Clinton presidency given the Democrat\u00b4s vow to address runaway drug prices.

Those cost 5,000 riyals and 8,000 riyals each.Single-entry business visas are now priced at 2,000 riyals, several times higher than before.An oil industry source called the new tariffs \"crazy\" and a \"complete mistake\" if Saudi Arabia was seeking foreign partnerships.Since 2014, global oil prices have collapsed by about half, accelerating Saudi efforts to move away from petroleum which still accounts for the bulk of government income.In April, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 31, announced a \"Vision 2030\" reform programme to transform the world\u00b4s biggest oil exporter into a private-sector powerhouse with diverse industrial interests and major international investments.- Looking elsewhere -To promote job creation among Saudis and boost exports, Vision 2030 aims to foster small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) partly through \"international partnerships\".\"This will be achieved by attracting both regional and international retail investors\", the Vision says.But higher visa fees will be a \"particular disincentive for SMEs\", including those wanting to assess the market or meet potential partners, the first diplomat said.He and the Western diplomat agreed that foreign companies will now be more likely to consider doing business, and even meeting, elsewhere.Abdulrahman al-Zamil, former chairman of the Council of Saudi Chambers, says the impact of the hike in visa fees is being exaggerated.\"Most of those who are interested in our market.. can afford it. These are giant companies,\" said the head of Zamil Group, which employs 21,000 people in a range of sectors including steel fabrication and shipbuilding.\"The Saudi market is not really attractive to small and medium\" enterprises from abroad, Zamil added.Siyam, whose company secured about 5,000 visas last year, predicted a small fall in the number of business visitors, with only non-essential staff left out of delegations.\"This country, it\u00b4s a very important country, so I think those who want to come, they will still come,\" he said.", "label": 0}, "external-124": {"text": "ISLAMABAD: Nepra allowed increase in the losses of distribution companies (Discos) by up to 15.3 percent from 13.03 percent in 2004 in the power tariff, inflicting a loss of Rs2.1 billion per annum, reveals the government\u0092s official plan of managing the circular debt agreed to with the IMF, a copy of which is available with The News.Under the circular debt management plan, the government intends to reduce the circular debt from Rs314 billion (as of end of June 2015) to Rs212 billion by financial year ending June 30, 2018 while keeping within the target of 0.4 percent of GDP for subsidies to the power sector (about Rs128 billion) and 4 percent fiscal deficit. \u0093At the end of each month, the circular debt will be maintained below the cap of Rs314 billion. \u0093The circular debt management plan (or capping mechanism) will include reducing the increase of circular debt (flow) as well as the stock (outstanding amount). Policy induced public sector power entity debt including Power Holding Company Limited (PHCL) debt will be reduced from Rs335 billion to Rs220 billion by 2018. Collection from government customers will be rationalized, and subsidies will be on actual basis and paid according to schedule.\u0094 Independent energy experts say the power sector requires just over Rs1 trillion to run itself and if one percent loss appears in the system, it accounts for Rs10 billion. This means the consumers are currently paying over Rs150 billion in the tariff just under the head of losses. However, Nepra, which is supposed to pressurize Discos to bring down losses, has accommodated the inefficient power sector by increasing the losses to 15.3 percent from 13.03 percent. Nepra spokesperson admitted that the regulator had increased the losses of Discos by up to 15.3 percent in the tariff from 13.03 percent insisting that it will add the additional burden of Rs2.1 billion, saying one percent loss means damage of just Rs1 billion that will be recovered from the consumers in the tariff. Nepra had earlier fixed the allowed losses for Discos for 2013-14 at 13.02 percent compared to 18.7 percent. The 5.6 percent difference between determined loss and actual loss accumulated as circular debt of Rs33.6 billion in financial year 2014. Now the regulator for financial year 2015 allowed 15.3 percent compared with expected losses of 18.70 percent, narrowing the gap between allowed and actual losses, but it will still result in accumulation of circular debt of Rs32 billion due to increase in generation. In the short term, there is little that can be done about the flow because the tariffs have been determined. Nepra as a condition of its determinations requires Discos to conduct a study on technical losses to justify the need for increase and to set out future loss reduction initiatives, to be conducted by independent consultants but the results are unlikely to show an effect until financial year 2016 determinations. For the purposes of this circular debt management plan, it is assumed that reductions in losses will reduce the flow of circular debt from Rs32 billion to Rs11 billion. The privatization programme, according to the document, is also likely to reduce excess line losses to the extent of the companies that will be privatized. With expected privatization of three Discos in FY 2016, multi-year tariff (MYT) will have been determined instead of annual tariff determinations and this will give incentives to the new owners to improve losses against the Nepra benchmarks; in any event, the costs of any underperformance will be the responsibility of the new owner. For the Discos not privatized, the surcharge mechanism will still be used to rationalize subsidies dealing with Sector Inefficiencies and recover costs of service.", "label": 0}, "external-125": {"text": "strong>TAUNTON, United Kingdom: As a left-arm fast bowler, Mohammad Amir is often compared to Pakistan predecessor Wasim Akram.</strongBut having seen Amir close up during Pakistan\u00b4s opening match of their England tour, Somerset coach Matthew Maynard was struck by a likeness to a fast bowler from an earlier generation than Akram in 1970s West Indies great Andy Roberts.As well as sheer speed, right-armer Roberts was known for his ability to bowl a second bouncer that was markedly quicker than the first one a batsman had received from the Antiguan.They may have very different delivery actions, but having witnessed Amir mark his return to first-class cricket in England with three for 36 in Somerset\u00b4s first innings, Maynard was clear the 24-year-old had something of Roberts\u00b4s bowling intelligence about him.And this despite Amir having only recently returned from a five-year ban and jail sentence imposed for his part in bowling deliberate no balls as part of a tabloid newspaper sting during the 2010 Test between England and Pakistan at Lord\u00b4s.\"He was swinging it massive in the first innings, proper late big swing,\" said former England batsman Maynard of Amir.\"He\u00b4s a threat, he always has been, hasn\u00b4t he?

world\u00b4s top-ranked side in the shortest format, arrived at the sixth edition of the tournament with 10 wins from 11 matches in 2016 and were considered overwhelming favourites by fans, opposing captains and bookmakers alike.But while an opening Super 10 stage defeat to New Zealand, who reached the semi-finals unbeaten, was a wake-up call, the home side\u00b4s credentials came into question in a one-run win over Bangladesh, who lost three wickets in the last three balls.Virat Kohli\u00b4s wide blade was then called on to see off a stiff challenge from 50-over world champions Australia in a winner-takes-all contest to reach the last four, his masterclass glossing over some major batting flaws for the 2007 champions.Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma have failed to build a solid foundation for the hosts and their opening stands of five, 14, 42 and 23 have put pressure on the middle and lower order to provide a bulk of the scoring.Left-hander Suresh Raina\u00b4s scores of one, zero, 30 and 10 have not been overly helpful either, and calls for the number four batsman\u00b4s omission from the team have only gained momentum.Yuvraj Singh\u00b4s ankle injury in the win over Australia could open the door for Ajinkya Rahane to play at his home ground in Mumbai but the right-hander may be a little rusty, having not been involved in an international match for more than a month.\"You can\u00b4t rely on one batsman, yes the others have contributed, but still at the same time, if we can do a bit more with the bat at the top of the order and the middle overs, I think we will feel the

his exceptional calmness and savvy against Bangladesh as India stole victory.A win on Thursday will take India to a third final in the World Twenty20 under Dhoni after they went down to South Asian rivals Sri Lanka in the last edition in Bangladesh.The strong form of his spinners and accuracy of pacemen Ashish Nehra and Jasprit Bumrah in the death overs will give Dhoni hope of taming the West Indies batsmen on a surface that has done little to help the bowlers in three matches.South Africa saw a 230-run target chased down by England, who were on the receiving end of Chris Gayle\u00b4s assault when they failed to defend a score of 182.At the same ground, Afghanistan gave South Africa a scare while chasing 209 until they lost too many wickets in the second half of the innings on a surface offering little respite for the bowlers at a ground with relatively short boundaries.Afghanistan also inflicted the only Super 10 defeat on West Indies with their spinners finding a way to restrict their powerful batsmen in Nagpur.The 2012 champions rested Gayle for that game and a hamstring injury to Andre Fletcher, who has since been ruled out of the tournament and replaced by Lendl Simmons, hampered their chase further.But the inability to chase down a modest 124 would have not gone unnoticed and skipper Darren Sammy is hoping it was just a one-off and not a sign of inconsistency.\"We have to leave this game in Nagpur,\" Sammy said.\"We\u00b4ll leave this game here and see it as the blip in the tournament.\"Now we have two knockouts to play.

Trump campaigned against the overregulation of business and is expected to be more open to mergers than President Barack Obama.The investment announced Tuesday would come from the $100 billion investment fund SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is setting up with Saudi Arabia\u0092s sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners, according to the Wall Street Journal.Trump made the announcement in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan where he met with the head of SoftBank, a $68 billion telecommunications and tech investment behemoth.\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is Masa from SoftBank of Japan, and he\u0092s just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs,\" Trump said.\"He would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!\" Trump later Tweeted.Prior to the election, SoftBank said Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) would be the lead partner in the fund and could invest up to $45 billion over the next five years.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed at another record level on Tuesday, its 11th new high since the Nov. 8 vote.Should the SoftBank fund grow as large as $100 billion, it would be one of the world's largest private equity investors and a potential kingpin in the technology sector.SoftBank has also been stepping up investment in new areas.

But for the final, they evidently needed something extra.Harmony appeared to reign in the squad, Messi came back into the team after recovering and scored a record 55th goal for his country against the United States in the semi-final.But he also had a troubled start to the build-up to the final, openly criticising the Argentine FA (AFA) over disrupted travel plans from Houston to East Rutherford in New Jersey.He then decided to stay quiet over his team\u0092s complaints about a lack of proper support from the AFA until after the final, telling reporters: \u0093I\u0092ll tell you afterwards.\u0094However, Argentina's defeat on penalties for the second time in a year to Chile has overtaken Messi's concerns for now.", "label": 0}, "external-143": {"text": "MILAN: Milan\u0092s Expo 2015 opened on Friday with hopes the six-month food-themed world fair will be a catalyst for economic revival competing with fears it will simply underline Italy\u0092s deep-seated problems.The first global exhibition since Shanghai\u00b4s groundbreaking hosting five years ago has been beset by delays and the site was far from fully completed as the first visitors streamed in at 0800 GMT.Corruption scandals, fears of violent protests and evidence of a fledgling economic recovery running out of steam have all dampened the mood in the run-up to the event.But Italy is a master at delivering at the 11th hour -- the finishing touches to some of the stadiums for the 1990 World Cup came within minutes of kick-off.And a spectacular eve-of-opening concert, featuring tenor Andrea Bocelli, Chinese pianist Lang Lang and the choir and opera of the city\u00b4s renowned La Scala opera house performing in front of Milan\u00b4s magnificent Gothic cathedral, was a reminder of the country\u00b4s capacity to compensate with creativity for its shortcomings in the more humdrum aspects of event planning.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has been bullishly predicting that it will all be alright on the night, facing down the opponents who say a state with Italy\u00b4s unsustainable debt should not be ploughing money into an event that is, by definition, ephemeral in nature.Those opponents are due to stage a major march on Friday and fears of a spillover into violence were raised by incidents on the eve of the opening, when a few dozen masked protestors attempted to spray-paint and smash the windows of a branch of Manpower, an employment agency that is one of the official partners of the Expo.- Milan seeking reinvention -Italy secured the rights to host the Expo seven years ago, long before Renzi came to power last year.

Taylor anchored a relatively straightforward chase - the first time England have batted second in the series - after captain Edwards opted to bowl first under cloudy skies and England restricted their opposition to 131 for 4.England took advantage of the swing on offer and reduced South Africa to 6 for 3 in the second over before Mignon du Preez and Lizelle Lee built the recovery. They shared an 89-run stand for the fourth wicket to engineer a strong comeback - Lee's unbeaten 69 off 61 balls was a career-best - but South Africa's score on a good pitch and a fast outfield, never looked enough.South Africa's problems started early when Tash Farrant, the left-armer making her first appearance in the series, had Trish Chetty stumped down the leg side off a wide. In the next over, Anya Shrubsole found movement and bowled Dane van Niekerk, who was playing in her 50th T20I, and Marizanne Kapp with successive inswinging deliveries. She was not far away from a hat-trick with another full and straight delivery to Lee but a thin inside edge saved the batsman.Lee kept her composure and rebuilt steadily with her captain, du Preez. They complemented each other well with Lee the aggressor and du Preez the accumulator. The ninth over was the most profitable with Lee taking 15 runs off Jenny Gunn before offering a chance. Lee was on 30 and hit the last ball of the over to long off but Heather Knight could not hold on.South Africa still had work to do at 49 for 3 at the halfway stage. Du Preez shifted gears and helped by some ordinary fielding from England, started to speed up the scoring rate. South Africa managed 26 runs in three overs before Farrant was brought back to quieten things down.With not even 100 on the board and only four overs left, South Africa's urgency grew. Du Preez was run out by a direct hit after a trying to steal a second off a Knight fumble and it was up to Lee to finish strongly. She reached 50 off 51 balls immediately after du Preez was dismissed and played a part in South Africa scoring 35 runs off the last three overs. They still ended with the lowest first-innings score of the series and would have known it would be tough to defend.England were into their task early when Amy Jones climbed into overpitched deliveries from Shabnim Ismail. She scored 14 runs off the first over before Ismail had her caught behind. But, as was the case in Cape Town when South Africa made the early breakthrough, it brought England's best pair together but this time it was not for too long. While Taylor scored freely, Edwards could not get away and gifted deep square leg a catch to give South Africa some hope, although with Taylor at the crease, England could always feel safe.Taylor went aerial with confidence and was strong on the drive and cut. With Knight playing a supporting role, England were well on their way. Taylor brought up fifty off 33 balls and thoughb Knight was dismissed off the next ball England needed just 40 off 58 balls.South Africa claimed a few consolation wickets - van Niekerk took a stunning one-handed return catch in her follow through to dismiss Taylor and Ismail bowled Nat Sciver and Danielle Wyatt with full deliveries in the same over - but England reached the target with 4.3 overs to spare.

Investment in government securities touched new peak as such a high IDR level has never been achieved previously.Though yields on the government papers are falling (7pc on T-bills and 8-9pc on PIBs), an anticipation of further cut in discount rate pushes banks to lock-in funds in PIBs on high returns.Since November 2014, the cumulative discount rate has been reduced by 200 basis points following low inflation and positive outlook on external sector.The government is not firmly agreed with the analysts\u0092 view that banks are not interested in extending private sector loans and parking their whole money into the government papers.The government in its latest letter of intent to the IMF said, \u0093Private sector credit continued its healthy expansion (10.2 percent so far in FY15) driven mainly by businesses, and in particular manufacturing.\u0094Some analysts foresee bank lending to start expanding in coming quarters.

Kiwi team mates have not put a foot wrong since landing in India, winning all four group matches without really breaking a sweat to qualify for the semi-finals as the tournament\u00b4s only unbeaten team.For a side boasting an explosive batting order and a balanced attack to go with, England\u00b4s passage proved bumpier.Even before they could soak in the atmosphere, England were blown away by a

displayed the tactical flexibility needed to win a tournament like this.New Zealand sprang a surprise in their tournament opener, picking three spinners in a gutsy gamble and went on to beat India, renowned for their batsmen\u00b4s comfort against the turning ball, in their own game.Williamson repeated the ploy against Bangladesh in their final group match for a similar result, his immaculate pitch assessment in stark contrast to most of the visiting captains who struggled to read the track as if it was in Braille.Left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner and leg-spinner Ish Sodhi have already forged a formidable partnership for the Kiwis, claiming 17 wickets between them in four matches.And if Williamson has noticed England\u00b4s struggle against Afghanistan\u00b4s slow bowlers, the Kiwi captain will be tempted to harness Nathan McCullum\u00b4s control and accuracy in a three-pronged spin attack.As demonstrated by Martin Guptill, the Kiwi batting does not lack firepower but what was more heart-warming for the fans is how batsmen like Colin Munro have tempered strokes according to situations.\"It hasn\u00b4t been the wham, bam...sort of way that T20 cricket has been,\" batting

They tightened up on their discipline in the field but still gave away more extras than their opposition - six wides compared to two from Afghanistan - and did not show the kind of killer instinct that they will need later in the tournament.They also suffered an injury concern. JP Duminy left the field four balls into Afghanistan's chase with a hamstring strain and was unable to take any further part in the match. Duminy has only just found form again and his availability will be important for the rest of the World T20.Quinton de Kock picked up from where he left off two days ago and dominated the opening passages of play. Hashim Amla may have wanted to catch up but after one four, gifted a catch to Asghar Stanikzai at mid-off.South Africa held de Villiers back and sent in Faf du Plessis at No.3. The strategy worked. Du Plessis took on the spin from Mohammad Nabi while de Kock continued to attack in the Powerplay. South Africa finished it on 66 for 1 and 60 of those runs came in boundaries.When the fielding restrictions were lifted, Rashid put the brakes on with the first boundary-less over of the innings, but du Plessis did not want things to slow down too much. He picked up the pace before being run-out and de Villiers was soon at the crease.Afghanistan were not under threat immediately while de Villiers settled in and de Kock nicked off. After conceding just 19 runs in three overs after the halfway stage of the South African innings, Afghanistan might have been hopeful of pulling South Africa even further back. But Duminy and de Villiers were wise to the need to accelerate and began to push for runs.It was up to David Miller to take them to 200 after de Villiers was dismissed. Twenty runs off the final over ensured South Africa had a second straight 200-plus score.However, Mohammad Shahzad threatened to gun down that total all by himself. He began fearlessly against Kagiso Rabada and Kyle Abbott and plundered 32 runs off the first two overs. His partner Noor Ali Zadran did not face a ball until the third over and then, it was only to return the strike to Shahzad.Morris was brought on in the fourth over and showed improvement from previous performances. He started by holding his length back but then steamed in with a delivery just under 150kph - full and straightening - which splayed Shahzad's stumps.Asghar Stanikzai and was caught behind in Morris' next over but Gulbadin Naib kept Afghanistan in it and targeted David Wiese, South Africa's replacement for Steyn. Afghanistan reached 10 overs on 103 for 2, 11 runs ahead of where South Africa were at the same stage. Then, Gulbadin was caught behind, Noor Ali was stumped, and Afghanistan were wobbling, still needing 100 runs off eight overs. Their chase was over then and South Africa had the chance to drill home an advantage.Instead, they allowed Afghanistan to drag it out.

He is the competition's top scorer with six goals, having scored both goals in Thursday's defeat of world champions Germany.Portugal's master tactician Fernando Santos needs to cut supply lines to a player whom the French call \"Monsieur Griezmann\" as a sign of respect -- despite his boyish looks.It will be a challenge.While Portugal saw off Wales, the Welsh playmaker Gareth Bale was still given enough space to create chances and were outdone more by the absence of midfield creativity than by Portuguese prowess.That will not be the case for France who have a larger arsenal. Even if Portugal can snuff out Griezmann, Dmitiri Payet, the stand-out performer in the earlier rounds, can change a game in seconds.Front man Olivier Giroud has also proved a handful by weighing on defences and making space for those around him.strong>TEAM SPIRIT</strongWhat has worked for Portugal has been an incredible team spirit with a mantra that they are not playing to look pretty, but to win, irrespective of style.Santos has fashioned a well-drilled 4-4-2 and kept to it throughout despite injuries. The loss of Pepe at the back was hardly noticeable against Wales with Bruno Alves stepping in admirably.From France's match with Germany, Santos will have noted that Didier Deschamps' team has a weakness on its flanks, in particular on the left with Patrice Evra.The Germans pushed the French very deep by using their full backs almost as wingers. For much of the match, France's midfield duo of Paul Pogba and Blaise Matudi chased shadows, leaving Joshua Kimmich and Jonas Hector with acres of space.Portugal's full backs Raphael Guerreiro and Cedric Soares are good enough to replicate that, which could push Deschamps to move away from the more attacking 4-2-3-1 formation to revert to a 4-3-3, restoring defensive midfielder N'Golo Kante.But whether the Portuguese midfield has the capacity of a Bastian Schweinsteiger or Toni Kroos to stifle France is questionable.strong>NO DEPENDENCY ON RONALDO</strongDanilo, who replaced William Carvalho against Wales, was strong and efficient in the holding midfield role, but has limits going forward.Joao Mario and Adrien Silva do not appear to have the killer pass for Ronaldo or strike partner Nani. That may open the door for playmaker Joao Moutinho to return.What has been evident with this Portugal side is that they are no longer a side entirely dependent on Ronaldo. On the contrary, when he goes missing, others shine.In the quarter-final against Poland, 18-year-old Renato Sanches took the plaudits, while Nani has netted three times.Portugal's most high-profile player may have three goals, but his Real Madrid explosiveness has been absent. He has had to fit into Santos' team ethos, playing a less glamorous role. Captain Ronaldo tracks back and encourages his teammates.Arguably by being quiet he may prove more lethal. France's defenders can not fall into the sleepy rhythm Portugal have set during the tournament because Ronaldo has enough to turn the tide as his majestic header against Wales showed.", "label": 0}, "external-165": {"text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's newly appointed coach Mickey Arthur feels that dearth of international cricket at home has damaged Pakistan cricket and termed it as one of the reasons behind Pakistan\u0092s decline in the game.The former Australia and South Africa coach said that Pakistani batsmen will have to play an important role to achieve results for the team.\u0093Pakistan is playing all the cricket outside the country.

However pacer Kagiso Rabada shared the plaudits with a useful unbeaten 15 as the tail contributed important runs and then led the way with the ball as he claimed three for 13 off seven probing overs.Rabada disposed of Usman Khawaja in his opening spell and returned to account for wicketkeeper-batsman Matthew Wade and tailender Nathan Coulter-Nile in an excellent display of controlled fast bowling. His effort was supported by Wayne Parnell, who shared the new ball and got rid of the dangerous David Warner in his very first over.Playing his first ODI for almost 16 months, Parnell then trapped Australian captain Steve Smith leg-before.Spinners Imran Tahir and Aaron Phangiso then tightened the stranglehold with two wickets apiece, while Tabraiz Shamsi, the left-arm leggie, marked his debut with the wicket of Glenn Maxwell in his first over to ensure there was no escape for the Aussies.\"We started well with the two seamers although this wasn\u00b4t the kind of surface where they were having the time of their lives,\" captain A.B. de Villiers said. \"(Tabraiz) Shamsi was a handful for their batters.

Only Germany still have a clean sheet in Euro 2016.Poland's matches in France so far will have done little to prepare them for the pace, power and superhuman heading ability that Ronaldo possesses, however.Their top-ranked opponents to date, Germany, fielded the diminutive Mario Goetze in their group-stage stalemate and the 'false nine' presented little trouble in the box, constantly dropping back into midfield to pick up the ball.Other group matches against Northern Ireland, who did not get a decent effort on target, and Ukraine, who departed after failing to score in any of their games, were fairly straightforward.The late Shaqiri wonder goal in their last outing did unsettle the Poles, with Switzerland gaining the upper hand in extra time. But the rearguard held firm, forcing the tie to penalties.That defence will have to be immaculate again if Poland are to have a chance of progressing because they have offered little up front.They have scored two goals fewer than any other team in the last eight with hitman Robert Lewandowski, the leading scorer in Euro 2016 qualifying with 13 goals, mustering just two attempts on target so far, both in the last match.The captain's opening penalty in the shootout, which left the goalkeeper stranded as it flew into the top right corner, could be the confidence boost he needs.It is the scintillating left winger Kamil Grosicki who presents the biggest danger for Portugal's ageing but experienced defence led by 33-year-old Pepe.For Polish coach Adam Nawalka, the Ronaldo factor presents a tactical conundrum. Is he prepared to press high in search of a goal, knowing that a wrong step could unleash the Portuguese counter-attack, or does he sit back and risk becoming just a spectator to another Ronaldo masterclass?Whoever wins on Thursday will play either Wales or Belgium next, seen as the easier route to the final with hosts France, world champions Germany, Italy and surprise quarter-finalists Iceland on the other side of the draw.", "label": 0}, "external-171": {"text": "strong>COLOMBO: As noon-time temperatures began soaring in late March, Mohamed Nizam, a small-scale chicken seller, knew he was headed for trouble.</strongSoon the mid-day heat was touching 40 degrees Celsius, and Nizam told his workers to pour water on to the pavement in front of his shop in the Colombo suburb of Wattala in an effort to ward off the heat.\"But nothing can keep that kind of heat from getting to the chickens. It roasts them alive,\" Nizam said.Across Sri Lanka, small- and medium-scale chicken producers \u0096 often with between 1,000 and 25,000 birds \u0096 are struggling to keep their birds alive in the face of temperatures 2 degrees to 5 degrees Celsius above normal over the last two months.Many of the birds live in tightly packed pens, where the heat makes them dehydrated. Larger industrial operations use fans and spray water on them, but smaller operations cannot afford such investments.\u0093Usually when the heat is high, we use ice or water to keep the pens cool. This time they were no match for the heat. I lost half of my stock,\u0094 said Rumi Jamaldean, who runs a farm with around 8,000 birds in the Kurunegala District, about 120 kilometres from Colombo.strong>RISING PRICES</strongThe losses have translated into big hikes in chicken prices. In Colombo and its suburbs a kilo of fresh chicken was selling for 620 rupees (around $5.50) during the first week of May. Two months earlier it was Rs 450 and a year ago Rs 400.\u0093My sales have dropped,\u0094 Nizam said, estimating they had fallen by 40 percent. \u0093People can\u0092t afford it. The prices are way too much,\u0094 he said.With chicken by far the most popular meat in this largely Buddhist nation that shuns many other types of meat, the price hike is likely to have an impact on nutrition. On average a Sri Lankan eats seven times as much chicken per year as beef, according to the Department of Animal Production and Health.The nation\u0092s poultry industry produces about 165,000 metric tons of meat a year, according to the Department of Animal Production and Health.Sri Lankan chicken farmers have long experience with warm months and often use homegrown methods to keep their birds cool, including ice, water, fans or sometimes feeding the birds sodium-bicarbonate, which growers say can help prevent dehydration.But \u0093this time the heat was too much and nothing could have prevented such losses\u0094, said Nimal Jayaratne, head of the Department of Animal Production and Health.According to the Meteorological Department, during the fourth week of April the Northern Vavuniya District recorded an average daily temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. During the same time period, rain fall was below average.\u0093It has been extremely warm, warmer than any other time in the past five years,\u0094 said Lal Chandrapala, director general of the Meteorological Department.Experts and farmers agree that Sri Lanka\u0092s small-scale chicken farmers are not ready to deal with such extreme heat.\u0093If you look at the pens, they are just brick sheds with corrugated tin sheets on the roof. During times when the weather is okay, they can work. But when the heat comes, there is hardly any room for ventilation and there is no money to invest to save the stock,\u0094 Jayaratne said.Chicken farmer Jamaldean said he will absorb the losses as much as he can, pass some portion of it to his customers, and just wait until the heat passes, with cooler monsoon weather due late this month or in early June.But \u0093chicken prices will not come down soon.

Duminy removed Marlon Samuels and Denesh Ramdin respectively to have the hosts wobbling at 76 for four.But Pollard, whose first three scoring shots were towering sixes, dominated a 74-run fourth-wicket stand with Darren Bravo to take the West Indies closer to the target.Bravo fell to Phangiso for 30 and Carlos Brathwaite, the final over hero of the World T20 triumph in India two months earlier, perished attempting a bit hit of Phangiso.But captain Jason Holder joined Pollard to ensure there were no more alarms on the way to a morale-boosting victory for a team classified as underdogs alongside the South Africans and ahead of Sunday\u00b4s meeting with World Cup holders Australia at the same venue.", "label": 0}, "external-174": {"text": "strong>KARACHI:\u00a0 Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that it was the dream of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto to steer the country out of darkness of load-shedding by generating electricity on coal-fired power plants. \"She had started this work with my father Syed Abdullah Shah, the then Sindh chief minister and now Almighty Allah has given me the opportunity to realise the dream of my leader and complete the work my father had perhaps left for me.\"</strongThis he said while presiding over a meeting today at CM House to review the progress of Sindh Engero Coal Mining Company (SECMC) in mining operation it had started in Thar Coal Filed Block-II and to install a coal-fired Power Plant to generate 660 MW by 2019.

Brazil\u00b4s economy is battling a fifth straight year of poor growth and spiraling inflation. Li will head for Rio on Tuesday evening to see some of China\u00b4s investment in the city, which Brasilia supplanted as the capital in 1960 but which will in August next year welcome South America\u00b4s first ever Olympic Games.On Thursday, Li will continue a Latin American swing designed to increase Chinese influence in the region, heading to Colombia before visiting Peru and Chile.Chinese investment in Brazil has grown exponentially over the past decade, with the Asian giant becoming Brazil\u00b4s main trading partner in 2009.Trade between China and Latin America as a whole rose some 2,550 percent between 2000 and 2012 from barely $10 billion to $255.5 billion.Boom in Sino-Brazilian tradeSino-Brazilian trade mushroomed from $6.5 billion in 2003 to $83.3 billion in 2012.Jose Graca Lima, head of Asian affairs in the Brazilian foreign ministry, said ahead of Li\u00b4s arrival that a \"second generation\" of Chinese investment is under way. The first involved trade in raw materials and the focus now is on heavy industry and infrastructure, he said.Graca Lima said Friday that Rousseff and Li will ink a series of accords on political and commercial issues, and some 30 investment deals. One mooted project is a proposed rail link stretching some 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles) from the key Brazilian port of Santos to the Peruvian Pacific port of Ilo.Graca Lima said the plan would take some three to four years to realize, but he assured it is \"advancing,\" despite some environmental groups voicing concern.The countries are also expected to announce the delivery of 22 jetliners from Brazil\u00b4s Embraer to China -- part of a larger order of 60 airplanes from the world\u00b4s number three commercial aircraft developer.Brazil has seen its reputation hit by a huge graft scandal at oil giant Petrobras.

Bidders who did not meet \"technical requirements\" would be excluded, it said.Infantino was elected as FIFA president in February when one of his main promises was to increase the number of teams in the finals from 32 to 40, a proposal which is strongly opposed by Europe's biggest clubs.FIFA said that decisions were expected by October on the number of teams, the format for the tournament, the \"eligibility of (continental) confederations to bid\" and whether to allow joint bids.Joint bids were banned in 2011 but Infantino has said he wants to encourage them, possibly spreading the tournament around several countries in a region.strong>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION</strongFIFA said that a \"consultation process\", outlining new standards for bidders, would run until May 2017, followed by a preparation phase running until December 2018 when countries would have to submit their bids.The bids would be evaluated from January 2019 to February 2020 with a final decision three months later.FIFA was forced to reform its bidding process after the vote in December 2010 awarded the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to Russia and Qatar respectively.That vote is the subject of a criminal investigation by Swiss authorities, while Qatar's preparations have also been marred by allegations of abuse of migrant workers in the construction industry. Qatar says it is working to solve the issue.Under revised statutes, the hosts will be chosen by the 209 members of FIFA at its annual Congress. The Council, however, will still draw up a shortlist of three candidates. Previously, hosting rights were decided by the old executive committee.FIFA said that Gibraltar and Kosovo's applications for membership would be submitted to the Congress on Friday and that both would be allowed to take part in the 2018 World Cup qualifying competition if accepted.Benin was suspended with immediate effect due to legal interference in the country's football federation. A decision not to suspend Greece was ratified by the Council.FIFA Council member Fernando Sarney praised Infantino's leadership on Tuesday.\"Things are getting calmer in FIFA,\" the Brazilian representative told reporters.\"Gianni is talking about football, he is travelling around, talking to people and trying to put football back into our conversations because before we talked about everything apart from football.\"", "label": 0}, "external-177": {"text": "ISLAMABAD: Following its approval from National Assembly, the lower house of the parliament, the upper house Senate on Wednesday also passed the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) bill 2015 amid protest from some opposition members.During the discussion, members of opposition parties criticized the government for presenting the bill in the house and urged that it should be presented in Council of Common Interest (CCI) for consultation with the provinces before its passage. Senator Tahir Hussain Mashhadi of MQM said that the the bill should have been presented in the CCI. He said any tax on natural resources cannot be imposed without consultation of provinces, he said.Senator Nauman Wazir and Sentor Saleem Mandviwala called for need to find a mechansim of gas infrastructure development and suggested that concerns of opposition should also be addressed.Opposition Leader Aitzaz Ahsan and Senators including Usman Saifullah, Mohsin Aziz, Shahi Syed, Saeed Ghani, Usman Kakar, Sassui Paleejo, Robina Adnan, Naseema Ehsan and Mohsin Leghari registered their opposing comments on the bill during discussion.Opposition members belonging to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Awami National Party (ANP) and Balochistan National Awami Party staged a token walk out from the House.Earlier, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in his winding up speech said National Assembly has already passed the Bill and said the government requires Rs1000 billion annually to maintain and improve gas infrastructure in the country.He said that Rs100 billion would be collated annually through this levy and it would be used for gas infrastructure and added that no province is self-sufficient in gas.He said that the production of gas is 4 BCFD and demand is 8 BCFD adding that it is very necessary to fund some important projects.He said that TAPI is Rs1 trillion project but our share is of Rs100 billion.The minister said that the collection amount of GIDC would not be misused and the parliament would oversee it.Shahid Khaqan said that the CCI itself says that the GIDC does not come into its domain and federal government should settle it. He said that Supreme Court has already decided that it is not a tax but a cess.Defending further the Cess Bill, he argued that to bridge the widening gas supply gap a number of gas import projects were being perused including the Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project, LNG import projects and LPG supply enhancement project in public as well as private sectors.He said that in case the required infrastructure was not developed for the above mentioned projects the government would be forced to import liquefied fuels which are much costlier as compared to gas.Further Pakistan would also be exposed to payment of liquidated damages or payments. According to him presently neither the federal government nor any gas utility has adequate funding to implement the above project.To create the required infrastructure it was therefore necessary that a new Cess may be imposed.He also accepted the idea of some opposition Senators for forming a committee to point out anomalies in the bill, which would prepare its recommendations to make the bill

standards.The companies even abandoned deletion programme and were not meeting any engine specifications used worldwide, he added.The minister said the government would continue to regulate and strike a balance between imported cars and local manufactured ones to protect interests of consumers.The government was getting valuable revenue from import of vehicles, he added.He said the consumers were exploited for the last 25-30 years and the new policy tried to protect interest of the buyers.The minister said the policy would protect investment of new entrants and its consistency would be

were wiped off the value of British bank stocks as a political vacuum and economic uncertainty opened up by Thursday's referendum prompted widespread downward revisions to the outlook for UK growth,

But learning how to plant seed directly in his fields \u0096 rather than transplanting seedlings, as farmers have for centuries in parched Punjab province \u0096 is helping him manage scarce water better and get a decent crop. Growing rice this way \"requires less labour, less irrigation\", he said. The rice seed is sown straight into moist soil and does not require continuous submergence.So far 30 farmers have applied the improved, water-saving rice cultivation technique on a total of 48 hectares (118.6 acres) in Punjab province. With the traditional method, in contrast, rice seedlings are first cultivated in nurseries for several weeks before being transferred to flooded fields. About a third more water is required through the growing cycle, and the crop takes 15 to 20 days longer to mature. On average in Pakistan, some 3,000 litres of water are used to produce 1 kilogramme of rice, which is the main staple food.But as the country's already scarce water resources dwindle, there is increasing pressure to find more water-efficient growing methods. A recent report from the Planning Commission of Pakistan shows that, in 1951, per-capita water availability was 5,650 cubic metres. By 2010, that figure had plunged to 1,000 cubic metres and is projected to fall to 800 cubic metres by 2025, when the population is expected to hit 221 million.Finding ways to grow more food with less water will be crucial in Pakistan as climate change alters weather patterns, affects monsoon rainfall and reduces groundwater, experts say.Planting rice directly in fields may be one way to keep up food production and help reduce the migration already happening as hard-hit, small-scale farmers give up on their fields and trek to towns and cities in search of other work.INNOVATION BENEFITSMuhammad, who grows rice on his family's 15 hectares (37 acres) in Sheikhupura district, said switching to the new planting method had cut the amount of irrigation needed in his rice fields by around 40 percent, a crucial change as groundwater levels drop.\"This is really no small benefit,\" he said, smiling. \"This is helping us adapt to water shortages.\"Muhammad learned the new technique under a four-year agricultural innovation programme, launched in 2013 by partners including the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the International Rice Research Institute.The $30 million project aims to help Pakistan's farmers boost their profits while coping with climate change risks to the sustainability of water and agriculture, said John Groarke, head of USAID in Pakistan.Besides its work on rice, the programme has introduced heat-tolerant maize and higher-yielding wheat varieties, he added.Muhammad Ibrahim Mughal, chairman of Agri Forum Pakistan, a farmers' rights organisation, said traditional rice cultivation was time-consuming and laborious, as farmers spend long hours bent over in fields.It has also become less viable as river flows decrease and groundwater declines, he added.As a result, farmers are now increasingly willing to experiment with the new growing technique, said Sardar Karim, another farmer from Punjab province.Direct sowing is producing a 25 percent boost in harvests under ideal conditions on the test plots, said Iftikhar Ahmed, chairman of the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council.", "label": 0}, "external-182": {"text": "strong>NEW DELHI: When Ramazan starts, Imran Tahir will begin juggling the demands of observing his Muslim faith and playing a full day of international cricket for a team sponsored by a beer company.</strong\"I don\u00b4t think it is difficult to balance professional sports with practising your faith,\" insisted the South Africa legspinner, in an interview with AFP.\"It is very easy if you follow the right path.\"One of the world\u00b4s top spinners, Pakistan-born Tahir has played more than 100 times for the Proteas since making his international debut in 2011, after becoming a South African citizen through marriage.In his native Pakistan, the team regularly prays together on the field during internationals and the lunch break is extended on Fridays, so players and fans can attend the weekly services at the nearest mosque.And in Bangladesh, the only other Muslim-majority Test-playing nation, facilities have been set aside to enable fans to pray at the ground.Tahir is one of five Muslims to have been selected for the South African squad taking part in the tri-nation ODI series with the West Indies and Australia in the Caribbean that begins on Friday and runs until June 26.strong>- Lager logo -</strongThey include former skipper Hashim Amla, who along with Tahir has been given special dispensation not to sport the logo of Castle lager, the team\u00b4s major sponsor, as Muslims are forbidden from drinking alcohol.Muslims are normally expected to fast from dawn to dusk during the month of Ramadan, which begins in different parts of the world this coming Sunday or Monday.But they are allowed to refrain from fasting if they are away from home, as in the case of Tahir while he is in the West Indies.Tahir said that even if he did not observe a fast on a particular match day, he would still make it up at a later stage.\"I am thankful to Allah that he drove me closer to him,\" Tahir said, during the just-finished Indian Premier League.\"I try not to miss my prayers and the 30 fasts in Ramadan but even if I do miss them due to my cricket, I make up for them later on.\"The Lahore-born Tahir has plied his trade around the world, including stints in England\u00b4s county championship and the IPL, where he played for the Delhi Daredevils.Speaking to AFP in the Indian capital, Tahir said that many in the cricketing fraternity helped him observe his faith.\"I have come through all the different cultures of the world while playing cricket and I have had no difficulty whatsoever while following my path,\" he said, glancing at the clock to ensure he wouldn\u00b4t be late for Friday prayers.\"Rather they (players, coaches and support staff) give more respect.

By the time he began the final over, Ireland were still 20 short, and he demolished the stumps of Max Sorensen and George Dockrell to ensure there was no monkey business.Both sides were already eliminated but Netherlands were happy to get the consolation win..Only one Ireland player was allowed to bowl two overs and Dockrell's left-arm spin proved to be a wise choice, registering 3 for 7, and producing catching opportunities from three of his first five balls, two of which were taken. Seven dot balls out of 12, including an over in the Powerplay, was an astounding effort that might have brought victory.Dockrell found turn all the same as Netherlands' batsmen floundered against him. Tom Cooper slogged his third ball to mid-on, affording the opportunity to prey upon Roelof van der Merwe who was promoted to No. 3.It did not work out for van der Merwe. Twice, he slogged Dockrell's left-arm spin to the legside. Kevin O'Brien spilled the first - a slice to long-off and a grimace from O'Brien as he landed heavily, but van der Merwe's next attempt was entirely bungled and he fell off the cue end at short third man.The coup de grace came in Dockrell's second over when his turn outdid Wesley Barresi as he came down the pitch, leaving Niall O'Brien with a simple stumping.Stephan Myburgh was dropped on 9 by Paul Stirling at deep midwicket but was still restrict to 27 from 18 balls. When he was run out against the penultimate ball, the damage had been limited. Dockrell bowled only one ball at him - the first ball of his spell - and got away with a leg bye off his waist.Stirling addressed Ireland's chase when he twice walked across his stumps in Tim van der Gugten's first over to flick him over fine leg for six. But Seelaar's thrilling intervention changed the complexion of the game and Stirling fell to the next ball, his ramp shot was collected at third man.At 28.3 off 2.3, Ireland had opportunity even in a six-over game for a settling period, but their plight worsened when Gary Wilson and Stuart Poynter departed against van der Merwe within three balls - Wilson falling to a reverse sweep, Poynton skying a rustic slog.With 25 needed from two, and only five wickets remaining, Netherlands were suddenly favourites.

The opener settled Belgian nerves and Hazard in particular dazzled fans with some mazy runs, dribbles, and sublime passes that carved open the Hungarian defence.Despite their attractive football, a lack of clinical finishing left Belgium at risk during an encouraging Hungary fightback in the second half.Kiraly did well to block De Bruyne\u00b4s effort with his feet after he powered on to Lukaku\u00b4s sweeping pass behind the Hungarian defence.But De Bruyne headed Lukaku\u00b4s perfectly-weighted chip into Kiraly\u00b4s arms.

Striker Adam Szalai fired into the side-netting before rising above the Belgian defence to send a deflected header wide.Adam Pinter\u00b4s deflected lob forced Courtois to tip over, and then Roland Juhasz heading well wide from the resulting corner.But Belgium responded in style.Michy Batshuayi came off the bench to punish Hungary when he ran in unmarked after the hour to first-time his shot past Kiraly.The \u00b4keeper was then left clutching at thin air when Hazard ran across the edge of the area unchallenged to beat him at his far post.Carrasco added their fourth in the first minute of added on time when he powered down the middle on the counter to beat Kiraly.", "label": 0}, "external-199": {"text": "strong>RIO de JANEIRO: Roger Federer has pulled out of the Rio Olympics and will miss the rest of the season, including the U.S. Open, because he needs \"more extensive rehabilitation\" to prolong his career after knee surgery earlier this year.</strongLast month he described how \"one stupid move\" sparked a chain of bad luck - which resulted in left knee surgery in February and sitting out the French Open with a back injury - culminating in Tuesday's decision to end his wretched season.\"I\u0092m extremely disappointed to announce that I will not be able to represent Switzerland at the Olympic Games in Rio and that I will also miss the remainder of the season,\" the 17-times grand slam champion said on his Facebook page.\"Considering all options after consulting with my doctors and my team, I have made the very difficult decision to call an end to my 2016 season as I need more extensive rehabilitation following my knee surgery earlier this year.\"The doctors advised that if I want to play on the ATP World Tour injury free for another few years, as I intend to do, I must give both my knee and body the proper time to fully recover.

taking his eye off the ball, he ducked into a rapid Mohammad Amir delivery and was struck on the helmet.A concerned Amir raised his hand in apology and Rouse, who changed helmets, needed at least five minutes of on-field treatment before resuming his innings.But soon afterwards he gamely cover-drove Amir for four.Amir\u00b4s exciting career came to a shuddering halt during a Lord\u00b4s Test in 2010 when he and new-ball partner Mohammad Asif were caught bowling no-balls to order on the instructions of captain Salman Butt as part of a tabloid newspaper sting operation.But the 24-year-old Amir is now back in England and could make his Test return in the first of a four-match series at Lord\u00b4s on July 14.This was Amir\u00b4s maiden first-class match in England since the spot-fixing row

overs to spare.It is the first time in 50-over international women's cricket that a player has scored a half-century and taken five wickets in the same match.Chasing 166 to win at the Fischer County Ground in a match originally scheduled for Monday but delayed because of a waterlogged outfield, England cantered home by seven wickets after Kent opener Tammy Beaumont made an international career-best score of 70.She was caught at mid-on in a miscued attempt to hit Asmavia Iqbal's medium pace over midwicket, her only real scare came when she was almost run out on 49, sent back by Knight after setting off for a single.Her partnership with Knight added 96 in 20 overs for the third wicket as England enjoyed the best batting conditions of the day. Nat Sciver then joined Knight, hitting 27 of the 37 more required at the fall of Beaumont's wicket but contriving to allow Knight to complete her half-century before securing the winning single off Iqbal.There was a nervous moment at the start of England's chase when opener Lauren Winfield was caught at slip off the first ball but though Pakistan's captain, the offspinner Sana Mir, bowled Georgia Elwiss for 12, at 53 for 2 from 10 overs England were already on target for a comfortable win.Pakistan\u00b4s 165 all out was built around opener Sidra Ameen\u00b4s 52 but none of her team-mates could offer much in the way of support with the bat.It was a day to remember, too, for strike bowler Katherine Brunt, who became only the fourth England player to take 100 ODI wickets.Pakistan's score was their highest in five one-day internationals against England but would have been regarded as disappointing given the platform provided by opener Sidra\u0092s maiden ODI half-century.The 24-year-old right-hander from Lahore had made more than half her side's runs off the bat when she was fifth out at 106 in the 32nd over but support was lacking from Pakistan's top and middle order and had it not been for a late show of aggression from Sidra Nawaz and Iqbal then England's task would have been even more straightforward.Asked for bat first on a surface that was predictably sluggish after the wet weather that forced this match to be played in its entirety on the designated reserve day, Pakistan struggled to build early momentum.They crawled to 29 for 1 after 10 overs, the wicket that fell being the one that mattered in particular to Brunt, when Javeria Wadood, tempted by some width, edged the first ball of her fourth over and Amy Jones, keeping wicket for England for the first time in almost two-and-a-half years, held the catch.The result means England move into the top four places in the ICC Women's Championship. If they can maintain that position with eight matches to play they will qualify automatically for the 2017 Women's World Cup, of which they are hosts.England have now won all five of their ODIs

half, it took Atletico Madrid striker Griezmann to rescue a pale version of Les Bleus with a 90th-minute header at the Stade Velodrome.Coach Didier Deschamps replaced under-performing midfielder Paul

to a 4-2-3-1, with Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud playing solo up front.But after a frustrating first half of few real chances for the hosts, Deschamps was quickly reconsidering his options.Albania, missing captain and ex-Marseille player Lorik Cana through suspension following his sending-off in the tournament debutants\u00b4 1-0 defeat to Switzerland, deployed a defence-minded 4-5-1 that made their conservative tactics clear.And France, despite showing plenty of promise throughout, struggled to come up with the antidote.Payet, who hit a stunning winner for France last Friday, showed promise with a great delivery for Giroud but the striker\u00b4s header was a yard over.Albania midfielder Ermir Lenjani\u00b4s then sent a drive just wide but the Balkan minnows would threaten again.France\u00b4s offside trap was non-existent when Napoli defender Elseid Hysaj broke free on the right to collect a long ball and deliver a cross that deflected off Martial as Armando Sadiku ran in towards goal.It was a brief scare, and France responded with a string of mistakes that left Deschamps holding his head in his hands before the half hour.As widely expected, Pogba replaced Martial for the start of the second half, inspiring the hosts to a far improved performance.Seconds after kick off a great delivery from Giroud was helped on by Blaise Matuidi, but Coman\u00b4s header from six yards out bounced just wide.But France were given another scare when Bacary Sagna missed a dangerous delivery that came off the post, bounced off the head of Ledian Memushaj and went out for a goal kick.This time, the scare was big enough to prompt a rousing French response.Moments later, Payet met Giroud\u00b4s nice lay-off to hit an inviting delivery with the outside of his right boot towards the back post where Pogba rushed in only to fire inches over.When N\u00b4Golo Kante made a timely interception to help set up Coman on the left, Giroud timed his jump to perfection but his header glanced wide on 67 minutes.Coman was replaced by Griezmann soon after, and moments later Giroud rose to meet Patrice Evra\u00b4s delicately chipped delivery to fire his header off the post.Deschamps replaced Giroud with former Marseille favourite Andre-Pierre Gignac with 13 minutes remaining, but as the hosts maintained their push for the opener it was Griezmann who broke the deadlock when he rose to meet Adil Rami\u00b4s cross to beat Lazio \u00b4keeper Etrit Berisha.It broke Albania\u00b4s resolve and five minutes later Payet claimed his second of the competition with a

his photo taken with Federer, 34, before the warm-up and could hardly stop grinning.He even celebrated a practise serve with a raised fist as his friends went through their song-list at court side.But

game, the deafening roar rivalled the one heard when fellow Briton Andy Murray ended 77 years of pain by beating Novak Djokovic in the 2013 final.From then on the quirky left-hander's unorthodox shots kept 17-times major champion Federer guessing at times, especially his grass-hugging backhand slices and cheeky drop volleys.Federer joined in with some dazzling party pieces of his own but played largely within himself -- smiling occasionally as Willis bathed in an unfamiliar spotlight.Afterwards he paid Willis the ultimate compliment.\"I'll remember most of the Centre Court matches here at Wimbledon, but this one will stand out because it's that special and probably not going to happen again for me to play against a guy 770 in the world,\" Federer told reporters.\"The support he got,

It's amazing.\"With seven-times Wimbledon champion Federer finally starting to succumb to injuries at the age of 34, he missed the French Open after 65 consecutive majors, his chances of snatching back the trophy from Djokovic seem to be receding.Although writing him off a year after his mesmerising semi-final defeat of Murray would be foolhardy.Rafael Nadal is missing with a wrist injury, which leaves Murray as the main threat, especially now he has Ivan Lendl back in his coaching corner -- the man who guided the Scot to his two victories in grand slam finals, both against Djokovic.World number two Murray warmed up with a fifth title at Queen's Club where he beat Canada's Milos Raonic in the final.McEnroe, who is working with men's sixth seed Raonic at Wimbledon got a close-hand view of Murray at Queen's and was impressed with what he saw.\"Murray is playing great. He's obviously put himself in position numerous times,\" McEnroe said. \"But at the moment there's no question that the level that Novak is at is something that you rarely, if ever, see.\"With McEnroe in Raonic's box, eight-times major champion Lendl working with Murray again, Boris Becker plotting for Djokovic and now Richard Krajicek fine-tuning Stan Wawrinka's grasscourt game, the battle of the super-coaches looks like being as compelling as the on-court action.Wawrinka, seeded four at Wimbledon, has never been past the quarter-finals at the All England Club, but has proved previously that he can beat Djokovic -- as has Japan's Kei Nishikori who will be seeded five.While Djokovic stands in a league of his own and Murray is positioned ahead of the pack, there are signs that a new generation could soon be breaking up the status quo.Austrian Dominic Thiem, a French Open semi-finalist and winner on grass in Stuttgart where he beat Federer recently, will be seeded eighth while Australian Nick Kyrgios, quarter-finalist two years ago, will be dangerous at 15.Germany's Alex Zverev also beat Federer in Halle last week.\"Thiem, Zverev, these guys can see light at the end of the tunnel.\u00a0It's an exciting time for men's tennis,\" McEnroe said.", "label": 0}, "external-208": {"text": "strong>SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON: Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick quit President Donald Trump's business advisory group on Thursday amid mounting pressure from activists and employees who oppose the administration's immigration policies.</strongCritics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves.\"Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,\" Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters.Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group.Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc.

The Iranian government wants to show results from the nuclear deal; Airbus wants to get deliveries moving and Boeing wants the leverage it can get from European deliveries to Iran,\" another source said.The ability to renew Iran's ageing and accident-prone fleet is widely viewed as a test of the pragmatist policies of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ahead of presidential elections in May.Airbus said the deal was subject to U.S. Treasury export licences granted in September and November 2016.Republican critics of the nuclear pact want Trump to block the aircraft deals and have sought to hamper them by voting to tighten restrictions on use of the U.S. financial system.Airbus is expected to be paid in euros instead of the usual dollars and is likely to provide its own financing for the first few jets, adding to cash strains caused by a spike in customer financing for Turkey this year.Planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier called the deal \"a significant first step\" in modernising Iranian aviation, adding it included training, airport operations and air traffic management.However, both sides confirmed the Airbus A380 had been jettisoned from a provisional list first agreed in January.", "label": 0}, "external-210": {"text": "strong>ISLAMABAD: The production of jeeps and cars witnessed growth of 21.57 percent in production during the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, compared to the corresponding period of last year.</strongAs many as 168,363 jeeps and cars were manufactured during July-May (2015-16) compared to the production of 138,490 units during July-May (2014-15), showing a surged of over 21.57 percent, according to the data of Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS).The production of Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs) also witnessed positive growth of 35.65 percent by going up from the output of 24,794 units during last year to 33,632 units during the current year.The production of motorcycles increased by 16.65 percent during the period under review.

Job creation is among the government\u0092s top priorities.Apparel manufacturing presents the poor with job opportunities in Pakistan, especially for females, says Illango Patchamuthu, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.These employed women would in return spend more on the health and education of their children which will contribute towards the larger development goals of the country.Pakistan has a fast\u00a0growing apparel sector that accounts for 19 percent of its exports and firms are competitive with global exporters in terms of prices.Yet despite low prices in most apparel product categories, Pakistan lags competitors in reliability and policy continuation.

In the opener against Bangladesh, the batsmen started slowly but Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya exploded towards the close, and the bowling pack did exactly what MS Dhoni would have hoped for to stop the opposition well short. The win over Pakistan was equally comprehensive. Apart from three overs from Mohammad Amir early on and a phase when Mohammad Irfan troubled Yuvraj Singh, it was one-way traffic.Sri Lanka, on the other hand, started well via Tillakaratne Dilshan and Dinesh Chandimal in its first game against UAE but ended up scoring only 129 for 8. And though there was never any real danger of the target being crossed, it took Lasith Malinga\u00b4s brilliance to ensure the chase stopped at 115 for 9. Against Bangladesh, with Malinga sitting out, Sri Lanka was overwhelmed.There was no word on Malinga\u00b4s availability for the match, discomfort in the knee making his comeback after three months out last only one game. A team spokesperson said that Malinga was recovering. Keeping the ICC World Twenty20 2016 in mind, Malinga probably will be fielded only if the team is confident that it won\u00b4t be harmful for him in the longer run.India might also be without Rohit Sharma, the inswinging yorker from Amir that sent him on his way on Saturday having left an impact on Rohit\u00b4s left big toe. He didn\u00b4t train on Monday, though it was announced that there was no fracture and Rohit wasn\u00b4t in any pain.The good news for India, meanwhile, was that Shikhar Dhawan was in fine fettle the day before the game, spending a fair bit of time knocking the ball around in the nets.<br/> <br/> India has been on a roll of late, while Sri Lanka hasn\u00b4t had things going its way.

But Shah turned the tide when he had Root carelessly hole out off a miscued sweep on 48.James Vince and the recalled Gary Ballance were both lbw as they each failed to \u00b4pick\u00b4 Shah.Cook\u00b4s cut four off Amir took him to 61 and beyond Gavaskar\u00b4s mark of 9,607 runs as a Test opener.Amir eventually drew Cook wide and got the left-hander to play on to end a 124-ball innings featuring 12 fours.Jonny Bairstow had rescued England from many a top-order slump in recent times.<br/> But on Friday he was deceived into playing back to Shah and bowled by a top-spinner for 29.That left England 193 for six and they were 232 for seven when, after a prolonged review, Yasir won a tight \u00b4umpire\u00b4s call\u00b4 decision to have Moeen Ali lbw on the sweep for 23.Even before Ali\u00b4s exit had finally been confirmed, Shah had saluted his fifth wicket Friday by kissing the turf. It was the fifth time in just 13 Tests that the 30-year-old Shah had taken five or more wickets in an innings.Earlier, Woakes took a Test-best six for 70 as Pakistan, 282 for six overnight, were bowled out for 339.Misbah only added four to his overnight 110 not out before he was bowled by Stuart Broad.Amir, booed by a small section of a capacity crowd as he walked out to bat, inside edged his first ball in Test cricket in six years, from Broad, for four and was hit on the helmet next delivery when he ducked into another Broad ball.

He served as Secretary General from 1981 until he succeeded Joao Havelange as president in 1998.Blatter's reign was mired in controversy and the announcement that he was resigning came in June, less than a week after American and Swiss authorities arrested FIFA and other officials at a Zurich hotel on corruption charges, two days before the Congress and election took place.Platini was, for many years, regarded as Blatter's natural successor and they worked harmoniously before rifts occurred in their relationship.Platini was openly critical of Blatter in the run-up to last year's election, but both have been united again in being brought down by the scandal that has rocked their sport.", "label": 0}, "external-224": {"text": "strong>SYDNEY: As the humble daughter of factory workers at a Bangkok sweet-maker, badminton was a ticket out of poverty for Ratchanok Intanon, who hopes winning gold at the Rio Olympics might inspire more Thai girls to chase their dreams.</strongThe 21-year-old will be among Thailand's main medal hopes in Brazil and one of the chief threats to China's chances of defending their astonishing sweep of all five badminton titles at the London Games.Ratchanok is spurred by a painful memory of London, where, as a teenage sensation set to rock the Chinese establishment, she choked in a quarter-final when poised to defeat the tournament second seed, Wang Xin.\"Actually I think I had a chance to win or (be) close to the medals,\" Ratchanok told Reuters ruefully in an interview in Sydney on Tuesday.\"But I think I lost with the experience, because that time I was still young and she was also good, world class.\"So maybe... mentally she was better than me.\"That time, I didn't feel good after losing.

inflation is expected to reverse its declining momentum.Moreover market surveys indicate a marginal increase in inflation expectations for the coming months.The SBP statement further pointed out that the current account deficit despite a year on year 10.6 percent contraction in exports has narrowed down to $ 532 million in Jul-Oct FY16 from $ 1.9billion in Jul-Oct FY15. The improvement largely owes to declining oil price that has substantially reduced the oil import payments healthy workers remittances and the realization of Coalition Support Fund.At the back of official disbursements and Eurobond inflows surplus in capital and financial account has supported the overall balance of payments position thus ensuring an upward trajectory in foreign exchange reserves in Jul Oct FY16. Going forward continued flow of external resources would be required to maintain the stable balance of payments position.Furthermore, realization of investment inflows stemming from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor would indeed strengthen the external sector outlook over the medium to long term.Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) mainly supported by food and beverages, automobiles, fertilizers and cement production increased to 3.9 percent in Jul Sep 2015 compared to 2.6 percent in the same period of last year.Further boost to this growth is expected from expansion in cotton yarn manufacturing strong construction activities as per planned development spending increased automobile production encouraged by government schemes and improving energy supply at the back of recent LNG imports.Credit to private sector witnessed a nominal increase in July-October 2015 wherein fixed investments continued to expand for the fourth consecutive quarter from Q2 FY15 to Q1 FY16. As a result of easy monetary policy, the weighted average lending rates on fresh and outstanding loans at 7.8 percent and 9.2 percent in September2015 are the lowest in 10 years.Thus, with current credit cycle now entering in uptake phase and with improving LSM growth borrowing on account of both the working capital and fixed investment is likely to increase.This outlook would reflect in broad money (M2) growth going forward which during July 01-November 06, 2015 M2 has expanded by 0.2percent against 0.7 percent during the same period last year.While the Net Domestic Assets declined by Rs 78 billion Net Foreign Assets contribution in M2 growth remained substantial as it increased by Rs106 billion.In view of the foregoing the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.", "label": 0}, "external-229": {"text": "NEW YORK: Many American businesses are publicly breaking with President Donald Trump over his anti-immigration policies, saying they could damage competitiveness by limiting access to the best and brightest employees.Criticism of Trump\u00b4s order has been most virulent in Silicon Valley, where chiefs of tech firms Apple, Microsoft, Airbnb and Google were among those to blast the policy, unveiled late Friday, which prohibits people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, and includes a temporary ban on refugees.Protests erupted at airports nationwide over the weekend, while lawsuits led to judges blocking parts of the order, which initially prevented some legal US residents from returning home.Netflix CEO Reed Hastings called the policies \"un-American.\"Executives outside of the technology industry have joined in pointing out the perils of the immigration policies as well, although they are more cautious about provoking the administration, which is expected to pursue favored policies such as tax cuts and regulatory relief.Any criticism could trigger blowback from Trump, who has frequently lambasted individual companies, including Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Boeing and Lockheed.<br/> <br/> Company chiefs, in messages to employees, have emphasized the importance of a diverse workforce and promised to support employees.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who is on a council of corporate chief executives tasked with advising Trump on job growth, promised \"unwavering commitment\" to staff in a statement.Goldman and JPMorgan have vast international businesses that advise and provide financing to foreign governments, multinationals and private individuals.Boston-based General Electric, whose chief executive Jeff Immelt, also sits on a Trump business advisory board, came out against the policy.\"We have many employees from the named countries and we do business all over the region,\" Immelt said. \"We stand with them and will work with the US Administration to strive to find the balance between the need for security and the movement of law abiding people.\"Last week, Iraq signed a billion-dollar deal with GE for the construction of two power plants.

The guests of world soccer are more likely to be inside sipping lattes for eight times the price.FIFA has often been known for lavishing a five-star lifestyle on its delegates and officials. When former president Sepp Blatter went to an event in Zurich with the city's mayor, he arrived in a chauffeur-driven limousine while the politician came and went by tram.But after Gianni Infantino was elected president of soccer's scandal-plagued body in February, one of his first pledges was to make FIFA more humble, suggesting, among other things, that federation officials no longer wore suits to matches.The early signs were promising as he flew to Britain for his first official engagement by a budget airline rather than the private plane favoured by his predecessor.But this week's Congress in Mexico City has looked as extravagant as any held under Blatter.FIFA confirmed that it paid all the expenses for each of its 209 member associations to bring a three-man delegation, flying business class and staying in five-star accommodation.

FBR tax collections grew by 12.7 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, which were well below the 17.9 percent growth recorded in Jul-Mar FY14. Overall expenditures grew by 8.3 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, against 8.7 percent in the same period FY14. According to the report, the financing of budget deficit indicates that the government did not resort to inflationary borrowing from SBP; instead, it returned a huge sum of Rs 674.4 billion (on cash basis) during July-March FY15.As a result, the government was not only able to contain its borrowing from SBP within the IMF ceiling for end-March 2015, but also met the limit of zero quarterly borrowing prescribed in the SBP Act, 1956.The report also noted that the real GDP grew by 4.24 percent in FY15.

Yet, Bangladesh kept hitting the boundaries - they managed 11 fours and eight sixes to equal their own record of most sixes in a T20 innings.

But just as he started to rev up his engine, he also found a top edge that was easily taken by Brian Vitori at fine leg in the sixth over.Sarkar also looked authoritative by striking three fours and a six before Tamim fell and he then built the base further with Sabbir. But Sarkar threw it away in the 10th over as Malcolm Waller took an easy catch at deep midwicket to end his promising innings of 43.Zimbabwe were further boosted by the wicket of Mahmudullah, who fell to a superb catch by wicketkeeper Richmond Mutumbami. Then Mushfiqur Rahim batted through the second half of the innings to give Bangladesh a solid total to defend adding 52 for the fourth wicket with Sabbir.Sabbir made the most of a reprieve on 7 by Mutumbami as he lined up the straight boundaries well, even as Mushfiqur used the bowler's pace well in his 20-ball 24 before hobbling off the field. Shakib then finished off the innings with a cameo as Bangladesh took 50 off the last five overs.Masakadza came out all guns blazing, hitting two fours and two sixes in 2.2 overs, while Vusi Sibanda also soon got into the act. Zimbabwe were reprieved twice in the fourth over bowled by Mashrafe Mortaza. First, the substitute Imrul Kayes dropped Masakadza at cover, before Shuvagata couldn't reach a chance at midwicket.But Mashrafe soon had a wicket to show as Sibanda was bowled off the inside edge for 21 off 17. It was then that Sabbir was thrown the ball, and he delivered by having Masakadza caught at long-on for a 28-ball 30 that had three fours and two sixes. Sean Williams fell soon after to give Shuvagata his first T20I wicket and leave Zimbabwe needing a further 103 runs from the last ten overs.

But on Saturday he fell for nought when he lofted off-spinner Moeen Ali legside and Alex Hales, running round to the mid-wicket rope, held a good catch.Pakistan had never previously lost a Test when Misbah had made a hundred and never won one when he had made a duck but one of those records was now under threat.The unsettled Younis Khan played on to Ali for 25 two balls after driving him for four. Asad Shafiq struck a well-made 49 before,in sight of his second fifty of the match, he was bowled by a Woakes \u00b4trimmer\u00b4.Earlier, Shah produced the best innings bowling by a visiting spinner against England in a Test at Lord\u00b4s since Sid Pegler\u00b4s seven for 65 for South Africa back in 1912.Variations in pace and flight saw Shah repeatedly pose problems on an unresponsive pitch.Both sides knew that Shah was likely to be an even greater threat on a wearing fourth-day surface on Sunday.England resumed on their overnight 253 for seven, after Shah induced a middle-order collapse on Friday.They added just 19 more runs Saturday, with Woakes on 35 not out as he emphasised his all-round credentials.", "label": 0}, "external-239": {"text": "LONDON: Sri Lanka coach Graham Ford called for all no-ball decisions to be taken by the third umpire as his side reacted to an incorrect call in the third Test against England with an extraordinary flag protest at Lord\u00b4s on Sunday.At stumps, Sri Lanka were 32 without loss in their second innings, needing a further 330 runs on Monday\u00b4s fifth and final day to reach an imposing victory target of 362.More realistically, their goal was to prevent England, already 2-0 up in the three-match series, taking the 10 wickets they needed to complete a whitewash.But England captain Alastair Cook, 49 not out batting down the order after a knee injury suffered while fielding, may not have been able to declare his side\u00b4s second innings on 233 for seven had a few close calls Sunday gone Sri Lanka\u00b4s way instead.Significantly, Sri Lanka thought they had Alex Hales -- who went on to make 94 -- out for 58 when he was bowled by Nuwan Pradeep. But Australian umpire Rod Tucker had already called a no-ball. Replays suggested Pradeep\u00b4s front foot may have been behind the crease but fielding teams are unable to challenge a no-ball call by an umpire and Hales survived.In February, a similar incident saw Australia\u00b4s Adam Voges make 239 in a Test against New Zealand in Wellington after being reprieved on seven following an incorrectly called no-ball by English umpire Richard Illingworth.Under International Cricket Council regulations, the third umpire is powerless to intervene in such situations.There are proposals on the table to prevent a repeat of these types of incidents and Ford said: \"The ICC have to look at it.\"It seems strange with the technology available that you can still get a line call wrong,\" the South African added.\"The best solution is for the umpires to worry about what\u00b4s happening down the other end and let technology look after the line call. \"The game has a funny way of kicking you when you are down. That was a kick we didn\u00b4t need.\"The Sri Lanka management reacted to Hales\u00b4s reprieve by draping the national over the tourists\u00b4 dressing-room balcony for some 45 minutes.Ford said this wasn\u00b4t so much a protest as a gesture of solidarity with the players out on the middle.\"At that stage we felt the boys were fighting hard and we wanted to show our support from the dressing room to boost their morale --only for us to find out that\u00b4s not the done thing and we had to take it down,\" said Ford.He added that Tucker had apologised to Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews for his mistake.\"He got the news from the third umpire and he apologised to Angelo. It was very good of him to have done that and we move on.\"Hales, for all his good fortune Sunday, was still left waiting for a maiden Test hundred.The Nottinghamshire opener, out for 86 and 83 in the first two Tests, got closer still on Sunday before he was lbw to medium-pacer Mathews.Somewhat ironically, in view of Sri Lanka\u00b4s earlier protest, Hales sought a review of the decision only for DRS to find in the tourists\u00b4 favour on this occasion.\"It\u00b4s disappointing again to come so close,\" said Hales, whose 126-ball innings included 10 fours and a six.\"But it was pretty decent delivery and I had my fair share of luck -- bowled off a no-ball, umpires calls and edges -- I guess the luck ran out.\"", "label": 0}, "external-240": {"text": "LEEDS: A diligent half-century from Alex Hales, coupled with some home-ground know-how from Jonny Bairstow, helped England to regroup with a 88-run stand for the sixth wicket on the first day of the first Test against Sri Lanka, after their ambitions had been dramatically dented by the loss of five wickets for 34 runs either side of the lunch break.By tea, Hales was unbeaten on 71, his second Test half-century in nine innings and his highest yet, beating the 60 he made against South Africa at Cape Town in January.At the other end was Bairstow, who arrived at the crease with England's innings in crisis at 83 for 5, but responded with the sort of sparky counter-punching. Bairstow's 54 not out from 67 balls took the attack back to Sri Lanka, who nevertheless remained firmly in the contest at 171 for 5, thanks to Dasun Shanaka's sensational debut breakthroughs.After being put into bat on a morning when bowling first was a no-brainer for both captains, England's openers were obliged to rein in the extravagant strokeplay that has coloured so much of their cricket in recent months - a situation that might have been tailor-made for Alastair Cook. He began the match needing another 36 runs to reach 10,000 Test runs, and after getting off the mark with a sixth-ball clip for four through midwicket, appeared well set for the long grind until Shanaka's introduction, in the 18th over of the day, tore up the pre-conceived script.Shanaka launched his Test career with a maiden before striking with the first ball of his second over. Cook had been leaving the ball with his usual sangfroid for most of his 52 deliveries, but having creamed one cover drive off Nuwan Pradeep, he was drawn into another from the slower, wobblier Shanaka. The full length outside off left him a touch, and Cook scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal, the keeper. He was gone for 16, and still needs another 20 runs to notch up a landmark that has been on his conscience since the start of the South Africa tour in December.Three balls later, however, such thoughts had been whisked out of England's minds. Nick Compton - whose anxieties cannot have been aided by his team-mates' struggles to impose themselves - poked with caution at a perfect off-stump line and length, to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip. He was gone for a duck as Shanaka became only the third bowler in Test history, and the first since Richard Johnson in 2003, to claim two wickets before conceding his first career run.And, as if that was not enough of an impact on debut, Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally, as Joe Root - in such golden touch in all formats - was also drawn into a drive that scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip.It was a dream start for Shanaka, who had been awarded his Test cap by Mahela Jayawardene before the start of play, and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too, who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad, their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago, will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury.By tea, however, Hales and Bairstow had provided their team with a steadying hand, as a forecast rain shower swept in from the Pennines to delay the resumption of play.", "label": 0}, "external-241": {"text": "strong>SYDNEY: Big financial incentives for gamblers, small tournaments of little consequence to top players and the ease of fixing the outcome of a one-on-one sport have helped turn world tennis into a haven for match-fixers, according to experts and industry insiders.</strongTennis was rocked on Monday by allegations that the game\u00b4s authorities have failed to deal with widespread match-fixing, just as the Australian Open, the first grand slam tournament of the year, kicked off in Melbourne.Multiple sources told Reuters that the revelation was no surprise to those who closely follow the sport, where, out of the spotlight at small tournaments around the world, the temptations are obvious and malfeasance very difficult to prove.Dozens of untelevised tournaments are held annually and top players often inexplicably lose to relatively unknown opponents, said Steve Georgakis, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, who is researching match-fixing in tennis.\"If you have a look at the big tournaments, the Opens or Olympic Games, you\u00b4ll notice that in a lot of these tournaments the favourite usually wins,\" he said.But at a small tournament the following week, how could anyone prove that a top 50 player didn\u00b4t lose because they were exhausted or injured, said Georgakis.A highly ranked player is almost certain to be the odds-on favourite to win in these small tournaments and thus has the greatest opportunity to make money by intentionally losing to an outmatched player, handing a big payoff to those behind the fix.\"It\u00b4s a one-on-one sport and what you do is, you\u00b4re the favourite and you get a few other people to load up on the other player to win and then you throw the match.And you can never get caught,\" Georgakis added.Sports betting has exploded in recent years with the proliferation of online and mobile gambling sites, and could be worth as much as $3 trillion annually, Patrick Jay, an independent betting expert, told the United Nations in 2015.In that sea of money, tennis is the second most active betting market, trailing only soccer, research conducted by the European Gaming and Betting Association shows.Betting on tennis is relatively simple and comes with enormous potential payoffs, a professional tennis gambler told Reuters under the condition of anonymity.Many bookmakers have created disincentives to bet point-by-point or game-by-game with limits on those types of bets, pushing gamblers towards the payoffs for a winning bet on the overall match.\"Say you want to throw a game but win the match, why would you bother? You can only win a couple of thousand of dollars,\" the gambler said.Bookmakers are obliged to report suspicious betting patterns to the Tennis Integrity Unit, which was set up to police illegal activities in world tennis.But a source at a major bookmaker told Reuters under the condition of anonymity that it is ultimately up to the authorities to act.\"Most money is won by betting on the favourite, which is not a good result for bookmakers,\" he added.\"But if he\u00b4s up one set to love and then, in play, people start betting on the outsider\u0085that would be us getting on the front foot, most likely, to say (to the authorities) \u00b4is there anything you need for us to look into?\u00b4,\" the bookmaker said.", "label": 0}, "external-242": {"text": "HONG KONG: Asian markets tumbled Tuesday following painful losses in New York and Europe while the euro sat near nine-year lows as political uncertainty in Greece fanned renewed fears it could leave the eurozone.Oil prices, which fell below the psychological $50 a barrel mark in US trade, edged up marginally but remained under pressure owing to a global supply glut, weak demand and a stronger dollar.Tokyo tumbled 2.50 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.89 percent, Sydney eased 1.67 percent, Seoul was 1.30 percent lower while Shanghai reversed earlier losses to gain 0.70 percent.The first full week of the new year got off to a traumatic start for dealers as they bet a January 25 general election in Greece will see a victory for the the left-wing Syriza party.Markets fear the party will roll back austerity measures required under the IMF-EU bailout of the country, which could in turn lead it to exit the eurozone.The year is \"barely three trading days old and already the two biggest themes that were predicted to affect the markets this year are making headlines: oversupply of commodities and the eurozone,\" Evan Lucas, a markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., wrote in an email to clients, according to Bloomberg News.At the weekend, Der Spiegel quoted German government sources as saying they consider Greece\u00b4s exit \"almost inevitable\" if Syriza wins the snap poll.Chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had come to consider Athens\u00b4 removal from the bloc would be \"manageable\", the magazine said.However, investors were spooked and on Monday Greek stocks sank more than 5 percent, while the Paris, Madrid and Milan exchanges fell more than 3 percent.- Oil below $50 a barrel -The Dow dived 1.86 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.83 percent and the Nasdaq lost 1.57 percent.In currency trade the euro sank to $1.1864 Monday, its lowest level since March 2006.

But as oil prices have dropped lower than budgeted breakeven levels, \"it is important that they gradually, but in a determined way... reduce their spending (and) consolidate their fiscal position,\" Ahmed said.Oil prices have shed half of their value since June 2014, and are expected to be lower than the breakeven point for Gulf countries in the next three to four years.The Gulf Cooperation Council includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- economies all heavily dependent on energy revenues. A combined budget surplus for 2014 of $76 billion (68.5 billion euros) is expected to turn into a deficit of $113 billion this year, the IMF said in its latest regional report. \"They need to act to reinforce their efforts to diversify their economies to become less dependent on oil,\" said Ahmed, pointing out that many have already taken such measures.\"The UAE is more advanced in terms of diversification.

However, Afghanistan and Pakistan, stipulate additional hurdles for women entrepreneurs.\u0092This year, New Zealand has edged out Singapore as the easiest country for doing business in the latest rankings.The World Bank cited reductions in labor-related taxes and new regulations that make paying taxes easier as key reasons for moving New Zealand to the top spot from its previous runner-up position.Macedonia broke into the coveted top 10, while Brunei had the biggest improvement, moving to 72nd from a rank of 84th last year as it made electricity supply more reliable, passed a new insolvency law and increased protections for minority investors.According to the report, a record 137 economies made reforms to make it easier to start and operate businesses in the last year, with more than 75 percent of the changes occurring in developing countries.Kazakhstan rose to 35th place from 41st, with big weight given to its improvements in business start-up regulations, construction permits and power availability.

Pakistan knocked down the first of those pillars when Root, playing one of his favourite back-foot forcing shots, edged Sohail and was held by sometimes fallible slip fielder Mohammad Hafeez for just three.Left-handed opener Cook, carrying on from where he left off in Manchester, made 45 in 52 balls, including eight fours before Rahat Ali had him lbw.James Vince guided England to 100 for three at lunch. But on 39, an uncertain defensive prod outside off stump against Sohail saw Vince, yet to mae a fifty in his eight Test innings, edge low to second slip Younis Khan.Jonny Bairstow had rescued England from many a dire position in recent times.<br/> But he made just 12 before, trying to cut a sharply bouncing Sohail delivery, he was caught behind by opposing wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed.Ballance, increasingly assured after a shaky start, hit 11 fours. But his 150-ball innings ended when a glance off leg-spinner Yasir Shah was well held by Ahmed, who made good ground to hold the tough chance in an example of Pakistan\u00b4s much-improved catching. Ballance\u00b4s exit ended a sixth-wicket stand of 66 with Ali.Chris Woakes, on his Warwickshire home ground, was then caught behind for nine off an excellent Rahat inswinger.Mohammad Amir, who appeared to be nursing a calf problem, then struck twice with the new ball, including removing Ali when the batsman\u00b4s loose drive saw Ahmed hold his fifth catch of the innings.Sohail, appropriately, ended the day\u00b4s play when had No 11 James Anderson lbw for five.

furore over Saudi Arabia\u00b4s execution of a Shi\u00b4ite cleric has stripped nearly 8 percent off the price of oil in the last three trading days, killing speculation that OPEC members might agree to production cuts to lift prices.\"There are rising stockpiles and the tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia make any deal on production unlikely,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.Evidence of slowing economic growth in China and India has meanwhile fuelled fears that even strong demand elsewhere may not be enough to mop up the excess crude that has resulted from near-record production over the last year.Benchmark Brent crude futures were at $35.07 a barrel at 1318 GMT, down $1.58 on the day, and reached their lowest since early July 2004, having staged their largest one-day drop in percentage terms in nearly five weeks.US crude futures were down $1.25 cents at $34.72 a barrel after slipping 79 cents the previous day.Oil has slumped from above $115 in June 2014 as shale oil from the United States has flooded the market, while falling prices have prompted some producers to pump even harder to compensate for lower revenues and to keep market share.Adding to this oversupply, Iranian oil exports are widely expected to increase in 2016 as Western sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear programme are lifted.\"Shale production and increasing capacity from countries like Russia who need to protect revenue combined with expectations of further Iranian supply mean actual production as well as expectations of future production are rising,\" Hewson said.Still, a senior Iranian oil official said the country could moderate oil export increases once sanctions are lifted to avoid putting prices under further pressure.Also feeding into broad market weakness, a survey showed that China\u00b4s services sector expanded at its slowest pace in 17 months in December, following on from weak factory data on Monday which also knocked markets globally.The People\u00b4s Bank of China set a weaker midpoint for the yuan, prompting concerns that the economy of the world\u00b4s largest energy consumer could be in worse shape than<br/>believed.In the United

opportunity to finish how I want,\" said Phelps, of his motivation. \"I'm doing this because I wanted to.\"Thinking about the ups and downs we've gone through in and out of the pool to get to this point and not feeling an absolute 100 percent but still being able to get the job done.\"I think things are probably going to hit me a lot more emotionally now than what they would have in the past, because I'm enjoying the moment and I'm embracing the moment.\"For Phelps, this Olympic journey is more important than the destination, a trip into retirement that he is determined to share with his fiancee Nicole and infant son Boomer, who were among the sellout crowd of 14,000 at the CenturyLink Centre.At London, which he had declared to be his last Games, Phelps won four gold and overall six medals but walked away with the regret that he simply went through the motions.He subsequently talked of a golf career but eventually found himself testing the waters of a swimming comeback which was interrupted by a second drunk driving arrest in 2014 and a stint in rehab that laid the foundation for Phelps' transformation from a party boy to a family man.After accepting his medal for his 200 fly win, Phelps searched the darkened arena for his partner and child, joining them poolside where he hugged Nicole and planted a kiss on his son's forehead.\"I wanted to go over, and I've always given my family my flowers and stuffed animal, I guess that's his (Boomer's) first stuffed animal from a race,\" said Phelps, who will have Nicole and Boomer join him in Rio despite the Zika threat. \"I just

Federer missed this year's tournament with a back problem and Nadal had to pull out with a wrist injury after the second round.\"Obviously the guys I have been around the last few years have made things difficult for me,\" he said.\"But I guess I've got a few more years to try and (win more slams).

local media last week that his team had been discouraged from committing to the day-night test in Adelaide after getting feedback from Australian players, including captain Steve Smith.Test crowds

taxes.\u0093The amnesty was granted on clearance and a vehicle owner is required to file income tax returns and declare source of income,\u0094 said the source.However, the FBR failed to identify the real ownership due to apathy of customs department fraught with corruption and misconduct.The Federal Tax Ombudsman, in 2014, released a detailed report on irregularities in clearance of imported

In the same year-ago period, London garnered $12.4 billion while $11.3 billion flowed to New York, according to JLL.The 8.9 percent decline in cross-border investment New York experienced is in-line with the roughly 10 percent decline major cities experienced this year when compared to 2015, a stellar year in property investment around the world.Concerns the UK market was coming toward the end of the cycle amid signs pricing was reaching unsustainable levels only partially explains the drop-off in investment flows to Britain, the largest decline since the financial crisis.It is now obvious that people were becoming increasingly nervous about the Brexit vote, Green-Morgan said.Britain is viewed as more investor friendly than the United States because of beneficial tax arrangements. However, underlying property fundamentals - strong demand and not too much supply - must be in place to attract capital, as now is the case for the U.S. office and multifamily real estate sectors.The uncertainties created by Brexit has made investors more cautious about Britain and to a lesser extent about Europe, said Ken McCarthy, senior managing director, regional research director for Tri-State New York at Cushman &amp; Wakefield.

The idea is Strauss own and he outlined the thinking behind it at Headingley on Wednesday.\u0093Today I\u0092m introducing the Super Series the winner of which will be the overall tour winner for the Sri Lanka and Pakistan series over all formats\u0094, \u00a0said the former England captain.\u0093The rationale is that the game of cricket is evolving unbelievably quickly and I think we feel responsibility to ensure the international game develops. Central to that is context and relevance for every game of cricket you play. We believe the Super Series will provide that by connecting the formats and ensuring every game counts for something more than just itself.\u0093Two separate white\u00a0ball teams and a red\u00a0ball team will be connected by something greater than their own immediate interests. What this doesn\u0092t do is replace any of the individual series awards this summer so there will still be a Test series victory plus the one-day series and the Twenty20 match as well. But it sits on top of that wraps around it and creates something bigger to aim for.\u0093The ECB is very keen to be at the fore front of efforts to modernise the international game and we feel this is a good way of ensuring the game remains relevant in both fans and players minds.\u0093If the same points formula had been applied to England\u0092s winter tours, the outcome would have been decided in the last match and the Test series winners would have been pipped at the line.

He landed at Islamabad airport but was deported immediately on a special plane.The city of Rawalpindi, where Islamabad airport is situated, was locked down with containers in preparation.Since then containers have been freely used to control crowds, even those on routine religious marches.Containers are also used to create stages at political rallies and temporary residences and offices for leaders -- though in those cases they are usually paid for by the parties concerned.In 2014 Imran Khan joined forces with populist cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri to bring thousands of protesters to Islamabad for a sit-in outside parliament.The pair turned the government\u00b4s use of containers on its head: first, by embracing them as mobile offices, each having their own fully-equipped air-conditioned container with toilets, wifi and television.They also brought their own cranes and simply removed containers -- even those filled with earth and sand -- positioned by authorities to block their path to the high-security Red Zone in front of Parliament House.", "label": 0}, "external-296": {"text": "strong>Stand-in centre back Shkodran Mustafi headed his first goal for Germany and Bastian Schweinsteiger scored in stoppage time as the world champions survived several scares to beat Ukraine 2-0 in their opening Euro 2016 Group C match on Sunday.</strongMustafi, who started in the absence of regular centre back Mats Hummels, rifled home a header after 19 minutes to give Germany the lead, which was not extended until Schweinsteiger, a 90th-minute substitute, swept home from close range.Germany, bidding for a fourth Euro triumph but first since 1996, dominated possession, but also relied on three top saves from keeper Manuel Neuer and a goal-line clearance by Jerome Boateng to come out on top.Ukraine, playing in their second European championship, harried and hustled their opponents and their tight defence offered few clear sights of goal to the Germans.Yet lone striker Roman Zozulya was unable to offer much threat, except at the very start and in the closing stages as Ukraine pushed on in search of an equaliser.In a breakneck first half, Ukraine's Yevhen Konoplyanka forced Germany keeper Neuer to make a flying save in the fourth minute before the Germans steadily took control, with Toni Kroos orchestrating most of their attacks.It was from his free kick, that Mustafi, who last featured for Germany in March and only made the side because Hummels was recovering from a muscle injury, leapt behind Serhiy Sydorchuk to power in a header.Ten minutes later Sami Khedira had the chance to double Germany's lead as Kroos floated a ball beyond the defence, but he shot straight at the keeper.By then though, the Ukrainians had woken up and, driving their full backs higher up the pitch, forced Neuer to punch over a strong header from Yevhen Khacheridi.Boateng was then forced into a dramatic clearance, having first lost the ball before hacking it clear while back-pedalling into the net. Lone striker Zozulya also had an effort disallowed for offside as Germany hung on until halftime.Ukraine posed less of a threat in the second half, relying on hopeful long balls forward, while their keeper Andriy Pyatov was forced into action to save a long-range effort from Khedira, a low drive from Thomas Mueller and from Mesut Ozil, when he was through on goal.Germany suffered one final fright when Mustafi headed back over Neuer's head, leaving the goalkeeper to scramble back towards his own net, while appearing to body check substitute striker Yevhen Seleznyov in the process.Then, in the final seconds, with Ukraine pushing up, Germany countered and Schweinsteiger slammed in an Ozil cross to score.The result extended Germany's unbeaten run against Ukraine to six matches and maintained their record of never having lost their opening match in a European Championship.Germany will play joint group leaders Poland at the Stade de France on Thursday, when Ukraine take on Northern Ireland in Lyon.Several hours before the match, German and Ukrainian supporters scuffled briefly in the centre of Lille, though police quickly brought the situation under control.", "label": 0}, "external-297": {"text": "strong>SYDNEY: After picking up pretty much every individual honour on offer in a spectacular 2015, Australia captain Steve Smith has a more collective goal in his sights this year -- restoring his country to the top of the test rankings.</strongSmith finished his annus mirabilis as the world\u00b4s top ranked test batsman and won the ICC Cricketer and Test Cricketer of the Year awards as well as the Allan Border Medal as Australia\u00b4s best player.The 26-year-old scored a remarkable 2,369 runs across all three formats, rattling up 1,474 in tests alone at an average of 73.70 with six centuries.He was Australia\u00b4s highest run scorer as they secured a fifth 50-over World Cup triumph and he led the test side to series victories over India, New Zealand and West Indies.Even in the Ashes defeat to England, the one major blot on Australia\u00b4s copy book for the year, he scored his maiden double century to claim the Man of the Match award at Lord\u00b4s.Even before he was captain, though, Smith was always clear that team success came first.With Australia already 2-0 up in the three-match series, this week\u00b4s third test against West Indies might be a dead rubber but victory would send them above India into second place in the test rankings behind South Africa.\"It\u00b4s a huge motivation, that\u00b4s what we want to be, number one in all formats and we\u00b4re working extremely hard to get there,\" Smith told reporters on the eve of the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Saturday.\"It would be nice to win this week and wrap this series up 3-0.

The level of credit risk, however, will remain high as banks are heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign (B3, stable) through holdings of securities and government-related loans, which were equivalent in size to 7.3x Tier 1 capital, exposing banks to event risk.\"We expect problem loans will decline to around 12 per cent of total loans by the end of 2016 compared with 12.4pc for the end of June 2015. Banks, however, will remain heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign, linking the banks\u0092 creditworthiness to that of the sovereign\" Panayiotou said.In the area of capital, the rating agency expected that buffers will come under pressure due to moderate asset growth and lower internal capital generation \u0096 a result of weaker profitability.Moody\u0092s expected earnings to ease slightly over the outlook period, mainly because of the lower coupon on government securities in a declining interest rate environment and as the market\u0092s perception of Pakistan\u0092s risk profile eases (upgraded to B3 from Caa1 on June 11, 2015). Higher loan volumes and capital gains booked through the sale of government securities will only partially offset the pressure on profitability.In addition, the rating agency expected that Pakistani banks will maintain ample liquidity and continue to benefit from large volumes of low-cost and stable customer deposits.\"The Pakistani banks\u0092 deposit-based funding structure remains a credit strength.

That figure is much lower than OPEC's January output of 32.63 million bpd.\"Persistent speculation about a deal between OPEC and leading non-OPEC producers to cut output appears to be just that: speculation. It is OPEC's business whether or not it makes output cuts either alone or in concert with other producers but the likelihood of coordinated cuts is very low,\" the IEA said.Oil prices collapsed over the past 18 months to below $30 a barrel from as high as $115 as OPEC opened its taps to drive higher-cost producers such as U.S. shale companies out of the market.Low oil prices have spurred global demand but it was not enough to absorb all crude produced. As a result, unwanted oil went into storage, leading to record global stockpiles of over 3 billion barrels.U.S. shale oil output has started to decline because of low prices and OPEC has said it sees the market rebalancing sometime later in 2016 when demand finally meets supply.But the IEA said supply may still exceed demand throughout the whole of 2016 and added it saw non-OPEC output falling by just 0.6 million bpd in 2016.\"The number could be higher of course and many senior international oil company figures have said so but there is a lingering feeling that the big fall-off in production from U.S. shale producers is taking an awful long time to happen. Perhaps resilience still has some way to go,\" the IEA said.The agency also said it saw the dollar remaining strong as it benefits from its safe-haven status, meaning more downward pressure on oil prices.With weaker global oil demand, likely new gains in Iraqi, Iranian and Saudi output, low chances of an OPEC deal, resilient U.S. production and a strong dollar - the IEA said the global oil glut was only poised to worsen.It said that even if OPEC production remained flat, global stocks would build by 2 million bpd in the first quarter, followed by a 1.5-million-bpd build in the second quarter.\"Supply and demand data for the second half of the year suggests more stock building, this time by 0.3 million bpd. If these numbers prove to be accurate, and with the market already awash in oil, it is very hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly in the short term.

They reached 196 for 6, thanks to helpful hands from the top five, which today included a pinch-hitting Hardik Pandva. That total was 69 too many for Sri Lanka.On a pitch with little pace and minimal seam movement, the pacers that had delivered Sri Lanka's Pune win, were expensive. Even Sri Lanka's first T20 international hat-trick - to Thisara Perera - barely made a difference, coming as it did in the penultimate over. Dinesh Chandimal will perhaps rue having chosen to bowl first.R Ashwin had troubled Sri Lanka's batsmen even on the Pune green top, and MS Dhoni savvily had him open the bowling here. Ashwin removed a returning Tillakaratne Dilshan second ball, and the chase never really recovered from that. Soon they were 3 for 16, Ashish Nehra claiming two early scalps. Chandimal and Chamara Kapugedara then embarked on a recovery that was far too slow to give the visitors any real chance of victory, and wickets tumbled late in the middle overs, as the required rate crept up through the teens. Ashwin finished with 3 for 14 from his four overs.Dhawan got to 50 off his 22nd delivery, but departed soon after, nicking a throat-high Dushmantha Chameera ball to the keeper.

They bowled five overs for 30, before the runs began to flow again.Chameera claimed Rohit's scalp in the 14th over, with an athletic return catch, and Senanayake removed Rahane soon after, but India's final push began when Pandya arrived at the crease a few places higher than he would normally bat. After two sighters he began his assault.Raina added his own finishing blows to the closing surge, taking particular liking to Chameera, whose figures he ruined. Having sent down his first two overs for 10 runs, Chameera saw his third disappear for 18. His last also went for 10. In between Perera took a low-key hat-trick, having Pandya, Raina and Yuvraj Singh hole out to low full tosses. His figures were dramatically improved as a result. He finished with 3 for 33 from three overs.Dilshan was stumped over-reaching off the first ball he faced. Seekkuge Prasanna was sent up the order to provide some early impetus, but lacked the technique to deal with the new ball, and chewed up four balls for one run.

In October they surged more than threefold compared with the same month last year, rising to 789,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to ship tracking data and a report compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts.That compares to 697,000 bpd supplied last month by Saudi Arabia.

result left Sweden in an uncomfortable position with one point after two games ahead of their final group clash against Belgium next week.Sweden were well organised at the back but toothless in attack, with their danger man Zlatan Ibrahimovic looking a shadow of his brilliant best and hardly creating a chance.Italy, who came into the tournament with questions surrounding the strength of their squad, but surprised many with their superb performance against a highly-fancied Belgium side, relied on their trademark, tight defence against the Swedes.They rarely threatened up front, however, until Marco Parolo hit the crossbar with a header shortly before Eder netted the winner.\"It was a difficult game,\" Italy coach Antonio Conte told Rai Sport. \"We struggled in the first half.\"The boys did well to ride the storm and hurt Sweden when we needed to.\"Italy had been praised for their unity and work rate in their opening win over Belgium, but appeared to have no answer to Sweden's organised rearguard until Eder's late intervention.Sweden coach Erik Hamren had criticised their lack of attacking vitality following their opening 1-1 draw with Ireland, and while there was an improvement in their overall performance, Ibrahimovic once again failed to provide a cutting edge and live up to his billing.\"We were much better than the Italians for periods, but we didn\u0092t

space for Antonio Candreva, but Andreas Isaksson and Erik Johansson combined to clear his testing deliveries, while Ibrahimovic flashed a close-range header wide towards the end of the first half.Having masterminded victory over the Belgians, Conte's tactics were completely neutralised during the opening 45 minutes in Toulouse and his side appeared unsettled as a result.\"At halftime Conte told us we were too slow and he was right,\" Parolo told Rai Sport.\"We changed the tempo after the break and we deserved our victory.\"Conte introduced Simone Zaza in the 60th minute and he had

Then came Tendai Chisoro's three-wicket haul that applied the brakes on Bangladesh's chase of 181 as the visitors levelled the series at 2-2 with an 18-run win in Khulna.While Chisoro picked up the key wickets of Sabbir Rahman and Shakib Al Hasan, and Mahmudullah, Neville Madziva, the pacer, did the damage at the start and towards the end as Bangladesh were bowled out for 162 in 19 overs to lose by 18 runs.Bangladesh's chase started badly as the top four were blown away with just 17 on the board. Mahmudullah and Imrul Kayes tried to resurrect the innings; Kayes slamming two fours and a six to briefly get the crowd going. But an attempted hoick over deep midwicket brought an end to his innings for a 14-ball 18 in the seventh over.Mahmudullah, meanwhile, rode luck found boundaries through edges and clips, but he soon got into his zone by hammering sixes over deep midwicket and long-off. Along the way, he was also a recipient of a huge slice of luck when he was dropped by Vusi Sibanda on 13.Nurul Hasan and Mahmudullah added 57 runs in 6.3 overs as the scales started to tilt again. But Sikander Raza revived Zimbabwe's hopes as he had Nurul, who was caught at cover. Mashrafe Mortaza, who has shown ability to wield the long handle, struck him for a four and six in the same over to reduce the equation down to 60 off the last six overs.A hint of panic endured as Elton Chigumbura threw the ball to his frontline spinner Graeme Cremer. Panic turned into proper nerves as he too was tonked for six by Mashrafe. But one slog too many resulted in Mahmudullah's downfall at the other end as he missed a full ball from Chisoro. Abu Hider Rony swung his way around, but he his effort had to be consigned to being scant consolation for the hosts. He was the last man to fall as Luke Jongwe held on to a low catch at cover to complete the win.The game started differently for Zimbabwe as they lost an early wicket, but Richmond Mutumbami and Masakadza got them up and running with a brisk 80-run stand. Mutumbami was also reprieved by Taskin Ahmed at short fine leg to add to Bangladesh's woes.Masakadza brought out his entire range of strokes, using a combination of brute force and timing to negotiate Bangladesh's spinners on a slow deck. He too was reprieved on 36 as the hosts suddenly went off the boil. Despite dismissing Mutumbami for a 25-ball 32, Bangladesh didn't look like getting control as Malcolm Waller blasted his way to an 18-ball 36 to strengthen Zimbabwe's base.On the night, the final flourish proved enough as Zimbabwe ran away emphatic winners as they restored parity to head into the World T20 with some confidence restored following a demoralising limited-overs series loss to Afghanistan earlier in the month.

Islamic trade finance, which follows religious principles such as a ban on interest, accounts for only a tiny fraction of the trillions of dollars of bank-intermediated trade finance conducted globally every year.But the ITFC, which uses its expertise and funds to facilitate Islamic trade finance, says it is expanding its activities partly through new business with countries outside the traditional core areas of sharia-compliant finance in the Gulf and southeast Asia.Last month, it signed financing agreements with Djibouti, Comoros, Mali and Mauritania, and is exploring transactions in Guyana, the newest member of the IDB Group, Sonbol said. The ITFC approved transactions worth $6.1 billion in the financial year to last October, up from $5.2 billion a year earlier. It more than doubled financing approvals to sub-Saharan Africa; Egypt, Pakistan and Turkey saw some of the biggest individual increases in approvals.Difficulties in the global economy could dampen further growth but the ITFC aims for around $7 billion of approvals this year, Sonbol said.Traditionally, Islamic banks have not become heavily involved in trade financing as it often requires large balance sheets; they have left such business for Western banks to dominate.To overcome this, the ITFC has developed a network of more than 70 financial institutions which last financial year provided $4.2 billion via 25 syndicated deals, representing 68 percent of the institution\u00b4s total trade financing.The rest came from its own resources. Strategic partnerships are growing: Last year, the ITFC closed a $350 million export syndication in favour of Turkey\u00b4s export-import bank, and in February it signed a partnership agreement with Morocco\u00b4s largest lender by assets, Attijariwafa Bank.The ITFC\u00b4s mandate is to promote trade among countries of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).

More such sales would bode well for the Indian government that has been urging people to recycle unused gold in order to cut costly imports by the world's No.2 bullion consumer.Demand for new gold has been so weak in the past few months that India's imports over January-June halved from a year ago to 200 tonnes, data from consultancy Thomson Reuters GFMS shows.Arrivals for the year could hit 600 tonnes if prices stay near current levels, said Bachhraj Bamalwa, director at All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation.While this indicates an expected pick up in demand in the second half, when the festival and wedding seasons kick in, it would still be the smallest annual import since 2003.India shipped in as much as 904.5 tonnes last year, when global spot prices fell more than 10 percent.World prices have risen 25 percent so far this year, after plunging 36 percent in the past three years, driven in recent weeks by an economic uncertainty stemming from the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union.However, worries prices may move south again are prompting consumers to sell and bank profits while they can.\"The price correction since 2013 has changed perception,\" said Mukesh Kothari, director at dealer RiddiSiddhi Bullions in Mumbai. \"Earlier consumers were assuming gold prices will go up and up only.

Now we have played, now we know how to deal with it,\u0094 said Malik on the sidelines of the Pakistan team\u00b4s training session on the afternoon before the match.\u0093We had miscalculated. It wasn\u00b4t a typical T20 wicket where you look at 170 or 180. We know we have the best attack among all teams. But the batsmen have to take responsibility. Whoever gets in has to score 60-70, so the team ends up scoring 140-150, which the bowlers can defend.\u0093We should have scored 130. We had two run outs. Otherwise one of them might have gone on to score 40-50. Here, 130-plus is a great score, unless the conditions change.\u0094<br/> <br/> It\u00b4s unlikely that Pakistan will be worrying too much about its bowling. Amir, as well as Mohammad Sami, bowled extremely well against India, while Mohammad Irfan troubled India\u00b4s batsmen no end. Wahab Riaz did, however, have an average day, but it could well have been an aberration.Like with UAE, it\u00b4s the batting that Pakistan has to address. And fast. Both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have already beaten UAE and India could too, going by form. So winning on Monday is non-negotiable for Pakistan.

Wells drove flat-footed at a full delivery, edging behind seven short of a century, then Matt Machan was almost yorked first ball before being beaten by his second delivery.Finch, opening the batting for the first time in first-class cricket, reached his century in Wahab's next over, when he square-drove his 16th boundary, but two balls later was tempted into driving a full delivery and edged to slip.At the Sea End, Imran Khan picked up a brace himself, although they owed a little more to the batsmen's errors. Machan was lbw after a horrid swipe across the line then Ben Brown drove loosely at his first ball: 212 without loss had become 233 for 4 in the blink of an eye.Wells' innings was a continuation of a strong run of form for the tall left-hander who had made 181 last week against Glamorgan. His fifty off 54 balls included 10 boundaries and seven more followed before Wahab found his edge.Finch, whose previous first-class hundred had come against Leeds/Bradford MCCU at the start of this season, gave one chance on 64 when he drove low to short cover off Zulfiqar Babar, but he was particularly impressive on the front foot. His century also included three sixes.Having come in to face a hat-trick ball on first-class debut, Philip Salt played positively after tea before Craig Cachopa was given lbw on the front foot to Zulfiqar to bring the declaration with 24 overs left in the day.For the fourth time on the tour, Mohammad Hafeez reached double figures but not much further when, on 23, he pulled Jofra Archer to deep square leg. As a senior batsman, Pakistan will need Hafeez to lift his game in the Tests to ensure Azhar Ali and Younis Khan are not constantly exposed to the new ball.Shan Masood reached the close unbeaten on 38 but was never entirely convincing.

2015.India\u00b4s bowlers made a mockery of all the lamentations of a placid, lifeless pitch over the first two days with an impressive, purposeful effort throughout the day.They were held up though at the start of play as Braithwaite and nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo frustrated Virat Kohli and his men for 75 minutes until leg-spinner Amit Mishra had Bishoo stumped by wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha.It was second of six dismissals for Saha in the innings, putting him alongside Syed Kirmani and Mahendra Singh Dhoni for the most dismissals by an Indian wicketkeeper in a Test innings.From that point on it became a virtual procession of West Indies batsmen to and from the wicket with Shami outstanding either side of the lunch interval when he disposed of Bravo, Marlon Samuels and Jermaine Blackwood to add to his dismissal of Chandrika late on the second evening.Debutant Roston Chase displayed a measure of grit in a 47-run stand for the sixth wicket with Brathwaite, but the reintroduction of Yadav for another spell in mid-afternoon proved telling.Chase miscued an attempted pull to give Kohli a simple catch at short midwicket and Brathwaite could not get out of the way of

shortly after Szalai ended an 18-month goal drought as Hungary made a triumphant return to a major tournament having last featured at the 1986 World Cup.Hungary goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly kept a clean sheet as he became the first 40-year-old to feature at the European Championship, surpassing Germany's Lothar Matthaus as the oldest player in tournament history.Austria captain Christian Fuchs and winger Martin Harnik were the only two survivors from the country's debut campaign eight years ago named in Marcel Koller's starting line-up.However, they were inches away from the perfect start when Bayern Munich star David Alaba went agonisingly close to justifying his billing as one of the potential stars of the tournament when his dipping left-footed strike from outside the area crashed against the post.The versatile Alaba, operating in his customary central midfield with Austria, soon fired another warning to Hungary with a first-time strike at Kiraly after a threaded pass through from Marko Arnautovic.Szalai miscued a header from a Balazs Dzsudzsak free-kick in a rare opening for Hungary, while Kiraly showed his reflexes remain sharp despite his advancing years to claw behind a low strike from Zlatko Junuzovic.Arnautovic then slid a dangerous low ball across the face of goal as Austria continued to threaten, but Harnik lost his footing as he tried to slide home at the far post.Hungary captain Dzsudzsak wasted arguably the best chance of the opening 45 minutes, though, as he screwed his shot wide of goal after he was picked out by Laszlo Kleinheisler on the right-hand side of the penalty area.Dzsudzsak again took aim 10 minutes into the second period, his stinging 30-yard shot forcing Austria keeper Robert Almer to fist the punch behind for a corner.And Hungary grabbed a surprise lead just beyond the hour when Kleinheisler slipped in Szalai, who was played onside by Fuchs, with the powerful striker poking the ball underneath Almer for his first goal at any level since December 2014.Austria appeared to have levelled when Martin Hinteregger rifled in from the edge of the area, but referee Clement Turpin disallowed the goal for a foul on Tamas Kadar with Dragovic dismissed for a second booking.And Stieber triggered delirious celebrations when he raced from just inside the Austria half to beat Almer three minutes from time with a sublime chip as

super-rich gather for this week's World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, the charity's report suggests the wealth gap is wider than ever, with new data for China and India indicating that the poorest half of the world owns less than previously estimated.Oxfam, which described the gap as \"obscene\", said if the new data had been available before, it would have shown that in 2016 nine people owned the same as the 3.6 billion who make up the poorest half of humanity, rather than 62 estimated at the time.In 2010, by comparison, it took the combined assets of the 43 richest people to equal the wealth of the poorest 50 percent, according to the latest calculations.Inequality has moved up the agenda in recent years, with the head of the International Monetary Fund and the Pope among those warning of its corrosive effects, while resentment of elites has helped fuel an upsurge in populist politics.Concern about the issue was highlighted again in the WEF's own global risks report last week.\"We see a lot of hand-wringing - and clearly Trump's victory and Brexit gives that new impetus this year - but there is a lack of concrete alternatives to business as usual,\" said Max

Usman Khawaja, among others, will be eager to make a difference.Australia made three changes to the team that was given a hiding in Auckland, dropping Shaun Marsh for Khawaja, while Boland came in for Kane Richardson due to back soreness, and the debutant Zampa was called up in place of the injured James Faulkner. Zampa had his ODI cap presented to him by Allan Border.New Zealand, by contrast, were unchanged, in a match where they can complete a series victory over Australia for the first time since 2007. Their captain Brendon McCullum led a typically hyperactive start to proceedings, clattering 28 from 12 balls including a six off each of the Australia pacemen.Boland's very first ball was sent flying back over his head and into the sight screen, but he responded well by pulling back his length and being rewarded when McCullum charged again and was bowled. That wicket scotched much of the early momentum, even if Martin Guptill and Williamson moved along smoothly enough for the next 11 overs.It was Mitchell Marsh who broke the stand, prompting a miscue from Guptill when he tried to force the pace a little more. The chance swirled out towards deep cover, where Khawaja showed excellent judgment to claim a catch more difficult than it appeared. Marsh had another victim when Henry Nicholls, called up to the Test team this week, wafted at a wide delivery. New Zealand had stalled.Williamson and Elliott formed another useful stand without ever looking in total command. This was in part due to the thoughtful work of Zampa, who varied his pace artfully to keep the batsmen guessing. His reward would come in consecutive overs, as first Williamson then Elliott pushed catches to cover as they tried to manufacture boundaries.That put New Zealand five down, and regular wickets from there prevented the hosts from pulling together a total of the dimensions they managed at Eden Park.

The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing \"significantly lower\" standards of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report that the files showed HSBC's Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw \u0093bricks\u0094 of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having had \"a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable tax obligations.\"Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone \"a radical transformation\" in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC's Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC's Swiss private bank.

Surprisingly he was not called upon by his captain, Jason Holder, in the first period of play, when even debutant batsman and part-time off-spinner Roston Chase delivered eight overs.However his dismissal of Pujara via a horribly miscued pull in the first over after lunch ushered in Kohli who proceeded to transform the rest of the day into a testament to his ever-increasing stature as a batsman of the highest class.Gabriel removed Murali Vijay for just seven after half-an-hour\u00b4s play when the right-hander fended at a lifting delivery for Kraigg Brathwaite to take the catch at the second attempt at second slip.Pujara looked untroubled on joining Dhawan at the crease with the pair putting on 60 before the middle-order player\u00b4s error of judgement at the start of the afternoon session.Having opted to go into the match without uncapped fast-medium bowler Miguel Cummins, the only other pace threat available in the West Indies pre-match squad of 13, it was left to Holder, fellow medium-pacer Carlos Brathwaite and Chase to do the bulk of the early work in support of Gabriel before Bishoo got into his work after lunch.Early in his innings, Kohli passed 3,000 career Test runs and later on reached 1,000 as Test captain. But the most important figures were the partnerships built around his excellent innings.His century stand with Dhawan was followed by a further 60 put together with Rahane followed by a fifth-wicket stand so far worth 66 with Ravichandran Ashwin.With two Test centuries against the West Indies on the Indian sub-continent, the lower-order player will resume on the second morning unbeaten on 22 alongside Kohli.While the West Indies have packed their side with batting, India opted for a bowling attack comprising three pacers and two spinners, omitting Ravindra Jadeja in preference for Amit Mishra to work in tandem with Ashwin as specialist slow bowlers.West Indies have not defeated India in Test cricket for 14 years since the end of the 2002 series in the Caribbean and are the decided underdogs for the first meeting with these opponents on home soil for five years.", "label": 0}, "external-375": {"text": "WASHINGTON: US employers added new workers at a surprisingly strong rate in June after an unnerving stall in May, in a clear demonstration of economic resilience, the Labor Department reported Friday.The much better-than-expected numbers gave a boost to markets in the US and Europe, which have been battered down by worries that Britain's vote to withdraw from the European Union will drag down economic growth.Private businesses and government authorities across the United States generated 287,000 new positions last month, 112,000 more than analysts had expected.The strongest hiring was in the health care, hospitality, information and retail sales sectors, while government hiring also picked up.That largely compensated for the poor numbers from May that had shocked policymakers and markets, sending the dollar lower and contributing to the Federal Reserve's decision last month to put off an interest rate hike.The May job creation numbers in fact were revised downward in Friday's data from the original 38,000 reported to just 11,000.June's hiring levels boosted the monthly average of the last three months to a solid 147,000, which economists say is adequate to keep bringing down unemployment overall.\"This is a good trend but nothing spectacular.

Wage growth, another indicator of economic strength, slowed slightly, bringing the annual pace for the last three months to 2.5 percent, compared with the 12-month rate of 2.6 percent.And the unemployment rate, which is based on a separate database from the job creation numbers, rose by 0.2 percentage points to 4.9 percent, though still near the lowest level in more than eight years.That rise was mainly due to a large jump in the number of people reported rejoining the workforce, diluting the impact of the hiring surge on the jobless rate.In May the unemployment rate had fallen from 5.0 percent to 4.7 percent after the volatile data showed a huge number of people had dropped out of the labor force.", "label": 0}, "external-376": {"text": "strong>S\u00e3o Paulo: Brazil's intelligence agency said on Tuesday it was investigating all threats to next month's Rio Olympics after a presumed Brazilian Islamist group pledged allegiance to Islamic State (IS) less than three weeks before the Games.</strongThe SITE Intelligence Group that monitors the internet reported that a group calling itself \"Ansar al-Khilafah Brazil\" said on the Telegram messaging app on Sunday that it followed IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and had promoted IS propaganda in Arabic, English and Portuguese.Brazilian authorities stepped up security measures following the truck massacre in Nice last week, planning security cordons, further roadblocks and the frisking of visitors in Rio de Janeiro for the Olympics.Police and soldiers took part over the weekend in drills near sports facilities and along transport routes.The Games start on Aug. 5 and are expected to attract as many as 500,000 foreign visitors.\"All threats related to the Rio 2016 Games are being meticulously investigated, particularly those related to terrorism,\" the Brazilian intelligence agency ABIN said in a statement when asked to comment on the previously unknown group's claim of support for Islamic State.\"Many are dismissed and those that deserve attention are investigated exhaustively,\" ABIN said.

no part in his death.\"I am of the opinion the attention received by Phillip after being struck had no role whatsoever on his subsequent demise, due to the nature and severity of his injury,\" it

She was of the view that any future reforms should focus primarily on inclusive and sustainable growth as it is imperative to bringing improvements in the living standards of the people.Minister for Finance Ishaq Dar said besides consolidating gains of the last three years, the Government would focus for next two years on growth, creation of job opportunities, poverty reduction and creating space for social sector spending.He said this has been reflected in the current year's budget, which is aimed at broadening tax net and improving financial disciple.The Minister said development spending has been increased from 300 billion rupees three years back to 800 billion rupees this year, social safety net expenses taken from 40 to 117 billion rupees and budgetary support for higher education has been increased substantially.Ishaq Dar expressed pleasure that for the first time the country completed an IMF programme and embarked upon comprehensive economic and financial reforms.He said when the present Government assumed power; it pledged to focus on addressing the four challenges of economic instability, energy shortages, low spending on social sector and extremism.

She represented the country as one of the \"Girls in Green\" at the recent World Twenty20 tournament in India, in between practicing her penalty shoot-out skills.She grew up playing street cricket and football with other children in the magnificent Hunza Valley, their makeshift arenas ringed by some of the world\u00b4s tallest mountains in northern Gilgit-Baltistan.Baig belongs to the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam, which largely freed her from the restrictions placed on other more conservative women in the Muslim country, where her gender is battling for greater freedom.From the streets, Baig began playing in community events and for local teams, and by 2010 she was leading the newly-formed Gilgit-Baltistan women\u00b4s team.Two years later, she was selected for Pakistan\u00b4s A side, and then as a reserve player for the 2013 World Cup. In 2015, she finally won her first international cap, playing for Pakistan against Bangladesh.Her journey to the forefront of Pakistani women\u00b4s football was even more dramatic.While playing cricket in Islamabad in 2010, Baig tried out for the Gilgit-Baltistan football team on a whim after friends told her they needed players.She made the team and, to her disbelief, in 2014 was selected to play for Pakistan at the SAFF Championships in Bahrain.She has been a member of the starting 11 as a defender ever since, she says, unable to hide her excitement.Baig has had to fight harder for her cricket career.Unlike in men\u00b4s cricket, Pakistan\u00b4s women\u00b4s players are not contracted and are selected on a match by match basis from lower-ranked teams, such as the several hundred playing at the provincial level.That means that there were times when Baig was in -- and times when she was out.Now Baig is fighting to maintain a crucial balance between her sporting dreams and education.\"It becomes very hard,\" she says. \"I try to start from football... I play football in the morning, then our cricket training starts around 11 or 12 noon and continues until 3:00 pm or 4:00 pm.\"After that, she says, she heads to her university hostel for food and drink. \"I start studying during the night, continuing until late.\"With cricket taking up more and more time, her studies -- she is on a full scholarship at the university, where she is in her first semester of a health and physical education degree -- are suffering, Baig admits. \"But one has to manage it.\"Though determined, she knows that one day she will have to choose.

England had lost Alex Hales, for a golden duck, and were 16 for 1.In Bristol, just like in the first two games, partnerships were severed by canny quicks whenever the visitors threatened to assume control of the match. In the ten overs following the 35th, Sri Lanka lost four wickets for 40 runs, and squandered the base their half-centurions had provided.Liam Plunkett and Chris Woakes claimed three scalps apiece, the former more effective with the new ball, the latter quite good with the old.Mendis batted as he has through the tour. He bludgeoned two Chris Jordan short balls for four and six at the end of the 18th over. Next over, Mendis completed a second ODI fifty with the 78th run of the innings, but then his panache forged his downfall. Attempting to repeat his pulled six against a taller, faster Plunkett, Mendis managed only to put the ball in the palms of deep square leg.Chandimal assumed a more positive outlook as he and Mathews manoeuvred Sri Lanka away from 88 for 3. Mathews ventured a low, straight six off Plunkett in the 26th over, but Adil Rashid's legspin was the more frequent victim of the pair's belligerence. The seamers returned the pair to a more measured approach, though they did continue to score smartly enough, relative to the situation: their 80-run stand was the heftiest in Sri Lanka's innings, and came off 87 balls.Having set themselves up at a reasonable 165 for 3 after 35 overs, the following ten overs were a period of significant decline. Chandimal, then Seekkuge Prasanna, were out in consecutive overs, both caught aiming swipes across the line. Mathews moved to his second half-century in three games in the company of Upul Tharanga, but top-edged a leg-side heave off Jordan to depart for 56 off 67 in the 44th over. Though the match situation was well-poised for Dasun Shanaka to showcase his hitting range, yet he attempted a non-existent single to short third man, and found himself run out cheaply again, by a sharp Joe Root.Tharanga then made the best of having to bat with the tail.

Kohli himself batted at 4.2 an over.Apart from Shannon Gabriel, no bowler - there was only one more specialist in the side - actively looked out for wickets, relying on frustrating batsmen. However, captain Kohli, India's first to score an away double, took risks and made the bowlers bowl to him because he was driving the wide ones too.Gabriel, though, should have had a wicket added to his one from day one early on the second day. Shane Dowrich had waited for 423 overs over three Tests for his first opportunity for a dismissal, but Gabriel produced the outside edge from Ashwin for a sitter, his eagerness to celebrate led to the sitter's being grassed. West Indies still managed to keep Ashwin quiet - at one point he went 40 balls for four runs - but Kohli kept finding a way around the defensive lines.Cover driving, as usual, remained the feature of Kohli's innings. When he gave the treatment to Devendra Bishoo in the 105th over, the boundary took him past his previous best of 169; it was his 50th run through the covers. A sign of how well he batted came in how, in the 113th over, he played perhaps the only ungainly shot of his innings, a half-sweep across the line to deep midwicket. Turned out he had picked the rare wrong'un from Bishoo, and was actually playing with the spin.Slow pitch, fielders in front, no pace to work with, and West Indies finally had a quiet session. Ashwin didn't look in any hurry, Wriddhiman Saha tried to break the monotony, succeeding on a couple of occasions before getting stumped to finally give Dowrich a maiden Test dismissal. Overall, though, West Indies refused to attack, which could also give India scoring opportunities, and India didn't seem overly bothered with the slow going.Seven minutes before tea, with a back-foot punch through midwicket, Ashwin brought up his hundred, reminding you of the shot of the day, a back-foot punch through mid-on for four.

If a player bears no fault or negligence, there is no suspension.According to Forbes, she earned $29.5 million in 2015, mostly from endorsements.Sharapova said her family doctor had been giving her mildronate, which is also called meldonium, for 10 years after she frequently became sick, had irregular EKG results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.\"It is very important for you to understand that for 10 years this medicine was not on WADA's banned list and I had been legally taking the medicine.

China's export data was horrendous,\" Matt Smith of Clipper Data said in a daily report.China's February trade performance was far worse than economists had expected, with exports tumbling the most in over six years.Although China imported record crude volumes of 8 million barrels per day (bpd) in February, analysts expect this figure to fall as the government scales back purchases of strategic reserves, and car sales begin to fall as the sharpest economic slowdown in a generation starts to show results.The price dips at least temporarily halted a price rally that started in mid-February on hopes that a coordinated freeze in production would stop growth in a global supply glut of at least 1 billion bpd above consumption that helped pull prices down as much as 70 percent since 2014.But OPEC-member Kuwait, this week poured cold water on hopes of such a freeze by stating that it would only cap output if all major producers participate, including Iran, which has balked at the plan.One key factor in determining the oil market balance will be US output, which the government said would be 8.19 million bpd in 2017, down from over 9 million bpd currently.But with demand growth also

They said salaried individuals were a soft target, and by forcing salaried persons for filing returns the tax authorities were trying to achieve their desired number.Earlier, the law required a person earning Rs500,000 per year to file tax return electronically. While salaried persons under threshold for income tax payment, ie Rs400,000 were also required to file returns, but it was not mandatory through e-filing.Muhammad Zubair, President, Karachi Tax Bar Association (KTBA) said the changes made by the FBR are disappointing, as this shows they only want to increase the numbers instead of increasing the tax revenue.He said that a large segment of salaried persons fall in the slab of Rs400,000 to Rs500,000, which also includes the lower cadre of any corporate entity. \u0093In some cases even a peon of an entity will be filing tax return,\u0094 he added.It is pertinent to mention here that a large number of the salaried class already files income tax returns on an annual basis. According to data obtained from a report of Tax Reform Commission, around 881,262 total returns were filed in tax year 2013, out of which salary returns were 235,117.Rehan Jafri, General Secretary, Pakistan Tax Bar Association (PTBA) criticised the FBR move and asked the authority to first enable its e-portal to handle such a huge number of filings.He said that the last date of filing the income tax return is August 31 and so far the return forms have not been issued by the FBR. \u0093It will create difficulties for taxpayers to file in a short span of time,\u0094 he said, adding the FBR should have issued the form on July 1 allowing at least two months for filing preparation.The FBR\u0092s new online software for filing income tax returns IRIS (Integrated Risk Information System) was criticised last year for deficiencies. Tax experts believe that without addressing the issues it will be another failure for FBR.Shahid Hussain Asad, Member Inland Revenue (Policy) and official spokesman said the measure had been taken to ensure electronic availability of taxpayers\u0092 data.As per tax laws all the individuals are also required to file a wealth statement along with their return.", "label": 0}, "external-421": {"text": "strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices rose on Wednesday after falling the previous session on expectations US output will decline further as some producers are under increasing financial distress and as early inventory data showed a less-than-expected increase.</strongUS crude futures CLc1 were trading at $36.86 per barrel at 0247 GMT, up 52 cents from their last settlement.Brent LCOc1 was up 39 cents at $39.13 a barrel.Oil rose after prices dropped about 2 percent the previous session.Inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday that US crude stockpiles rose 1.5 million barrels last week, less than half of what was expected by an analyst poll, lending markets some support.The US government's Energy Information Administration (EIA) will issue official production and inventory figures later on Wednesday.

In fact, it is just the opposite: speculators are buying what producers are selling... Speculators are record long Brent (on ICE) while producers are record short...

But energy prices have plummeted since mid-2014, causing steep declines in income and putting growth at risk.HIGH PROFILEThe wider reforms are expected to include subsidy cuts, tax rises, sales of state assets, a government efficiency drive and efforts to spur private sector investment. Last month the International Monetary Fund said the plans were \"appropriately bold and far reaching\".Details of the plan, a programme of wide-ranging economic reforms, will be disclosed in daily news conferences with government ministers starting Monday evening, the senior source said.Other parts of the Vision 2030, including a partial privatisation of state oil giant Saudi Aramco and transformation of the government's Public Investment Fund into one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, have yet to be approved.The emphasis placed on the plan by Prince Mohammed is evident in the high-profile nature of its launch, with senior ministers expected to deliver rare briefings on how their departments will implement the programme.The timing is also significant because Monday is the first day of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, when business and government activity in the conservative Islamic kingdom have historically slowed down.

The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody\u00b4s said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt \"will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit negative\". \"Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.\"The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody\u00b4s, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from \"negative\" to \"stable\" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a \"key driver\" in its decision last year. \"Circular debt\" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country\u00b4s oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moody\u00b4s warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. \"The government\u00b4s targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,\" it said.

The CPEC has long been seen as a flagship project in China's Belt and Road initiative and India's involvement would be conducive in pushing forward the initiative.India's economy has reportedly overtaken its former colonial ruler, the UK, to become the sixth-largest in the world by GDP. Now it seems the emerging economy is pushing past these current achievements. India is ramping up efforts to integrate itself into global manufacturing chains, and as such will need to boost regional economic integration and open new international trade routes to build an export-oriented economy.India could boost its exports and slash its trade deficit with China via new trade routes that would be opened up by the CPEC. In addition, the northern part of India bordering Pakistan will gain more economic growth momentum if India joins the project. It is understandable that cooperation between the traditional rivals may make India uncomfortable. However, New Delhi's attitude toward Pakistan's gesture can be a touchstone for the country's determination and courage in becoming a greater economic power.", "label": 0}, "external-446": {"text": "strong>CHRISTCHURCH: Australia returned to the top of the test world rankings on Wednesday after Steve Smith and Adam Voges steered the tourists to victory in the second test against New Zealand to seal a comprehensive 2-0 series win.</strongAfter thrashing the hosts in the first test by an innings and 52 runs in Wellington last week, Australia sealed the second match by seven wickets shortly after lunch on the fifth and final day at Hagley Oval.It was Australia's seventh win in 11 games under Smith's captaincy, while the match was also the 101st and final test for New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum, who now heads into international retirement.Australia were last at the summit of test cricket in July 2014 and Smith set course for a return when he assumed the captaincy from Michael Clarke full time after last year's Ashes loss to England.\"We want to win every series we play.

The planned reductions brought the sharpest weekly crude price rises in years.Russia on Friday reported average daily oil production of 11.21 million bpd for November - its highest in almost 30 years.And while Moscow has agreed to cut its output by 300,000 bpd in early 2017, it said it would do so against November levels. That means that even after a reduction, its output would remain higher than it was at the peak of the oil glut in the first half of 2016.Jeffrey Halley of brokerage OANDA in Singapore said oil traders were \"nervous (as) Russia's output has hit record levels, meaning their part of the production cut takes them back to what they were producing only quite recently\".In the Middle East, where the deepest OPEC production cuts are expected, there are also signs that production will rise before it gets cut.Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are expected to agree this month to resume oil production, with a potential of 300,000 barrels in daily output, from jointly operated oilfields which were shut down between 2014 and 2015 for environmental and technical difficulties.", "label": 0}, "external-455": {"text": "LONDON: Nuwan Pradeep took three wickets and did some serious damage to a couple of England careers as Sri Lanka fought to avoid a series whitewash in the third Test at Lord\u00b4s on Saturday.England in their second innings were 109 for four at the close of the third day, a lead of 237 runs.

the early loss of opener Shai Hope (nine), Kraigg Brathwaite and Darren Bravo (33) looked in fine nick as they ushered the tourists to lunch at 92 for one.Australia\u00b4s bowlers emerged from the break re-energised, however, and James Pattinson got the breakthrough when Bravo\u00b4s miscued pull sent the ball flying to Usman Khawaja running in from the deep.That broke a 91-run partnership and brought Marlon Samuels to the crease looking to break his run of eight test innings without getting to the 20-run mark.He failed in farcical fashion looking for a quick single that always looked like a gamble, left stranded when Kraigg Brathwaite scuttled back to his crease as Peter Nevill broke the stumps.After a long glare at his partner, Samuels headed back to the pavilion with four runs to his name and the rest of the players and umpires followed in his wake as heavy rain came down on the ground.Kraigg Brathwaite had brought up his eighth test half-century just before lunch by clipping all-rounder Mitchell Marsh past long leg for two runs off the 78th ball he faced. He fell 15 runs shy off his fifth test century when Lyon got a little bit of extra bounce to a delivery which caught the opener\u00b4s glove and was snaffled up by Steve Smith at slip.

Shortly before the New York market closed, the world powers and Iran said that Tehran has agreed to curtail its nuclear program in return for the lifting of US and European Union nuclear-related sanctions that have harmed its economy.Lifting sanctions could open up the flow of Iranian crude to an oversupplied global market. The glut has pushed crude prices more than 50 percent lower since last June.The outline of the deal marked a major breakthrough in a 12-year standoff between Iran and the West, which has long feared Tehran wants to build a nuclear bomb. Iran has insisted the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.At the beginning of the press conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, the price of WTI, which had been trading lower since the market opened, fell to $48.11 a barrel before paring its losses.The countries announced the drafting of a full agreement would begin immediately, with a June 30 deadline for completion.The sanctions would be lifted after the UN atomic agency verifies Iran has fulfilled the terms of the deal.The so-called P5+1 group \u0096 the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany \u0096 hope that the deal will make it virtually impossible for Iran to make nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian program.Commerzbank analysts, citing shipping sources, said earlier this week that Iran has at least 30 million barrels of crude oil in storage onboard tankers that could quickly move onto the market if sanctions were lifted.Iran has the world\u00b4s fourth-largest oil reserves. The OPEC member\u00b4s crude exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million bpd because of the US-EU sanctions.Traders also kept an eye on the latest Baker Hughes count of US crude-oil drilling rigs, looking for clues that the strong US crude output could be easing.

Finch and Suresh Raina then took the attack to the pacers, both capitalizing on loose deliveries along with intermittent swipes.After Raina holed out to mid-on in the sixth over, Finch peppered the boundary with deft touch and exemplary placement, particular behind square on the off side.His 47-ball 74 saw 12 boundaries, and it required a moment of brilliance from the debutant Pardeep Sahu to remove him. Sahu drew Finch forward but the legspinner beat him in flight and loop, as Saha completed his second stumping off the innings.The rest of the innings was a mere formality as Dinesh Karthik accrued his runs in typical fashion, with his sweeps being the most productive.Kings XI were given an ideal start by their openers - M Vijay and Manan Vohra - who saw off the swinging new ball before getting stuck into their work. A blend of crisp drives and flicks earned the pair a fifty-run stand within the Powerplay.The spreading field did not impede Vohra, as he manufactured boundaries with the use of his feet off the spinners.However, momentum shifted rapidly as Ravindra Jadeja struck twice in consecutive overs to remove the openers. Dwayne Bravo undid Glenn Maxwell and David Miller in the space of three balls with contrasting yorkers.Bravo became the first bowler to 300 T20 wickets with his new weapon - the slow, dipping yorker that deceived Miller.Suddenly, debutant Marcus Stoinis and Wriddhiman Saha were left to rebuild a rollicking start. The pair were forced to use the large Mohali pockets to find their runs, but struggled to find the boundaries towards the end. Much of that was down to the efficiency of the Lions bowlers, who executed their yorkers and slower balls.Bravo took two more wickets off consecutive slower balls in the last over, and could have had his best T20 bowling figures had Sarabjit Ladda pouched a skier off the last ball.

Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industry\u00b4s share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be \"reasonably rationalised\", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits.\"Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue,\" said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lion\u00b4s share of financing by the country\u00b4s Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent.

When van Niekerk was bowled as she tried to slog sweep Taylor over midwicket, and with the run-rate stagnating, du Preez took it on herself to try and force the pace. She managed only to gift a catch to short midwicket.Marizanne Kapp and Lizelle Lee also found it heavy going but with South Africa yet to reach 100 and only two overs left, they took some risks. Lee was the only batsman to clear the boundary and her efforts at the end gave South Africa something to defend but when West Indies knocked off the first 14 runs inside two overs, they would not have expected to be successful.Moseline Daniels had Kycia Knight trapped lbw to provide some early hope but that only brought Taylor to the crease. She tried to end matters quickly with her aggressive approach and when she was bowled, Dottin took over. It was only when Dottin was caught that South Africa fought back.Kyshona Knight departed soon after Dottin, sharp fielding resulted in the run-outs of Shermaine Campbell and Shaquana Quintyne and Shabnim Ismail took a good catch off her own bowling to give South Africa belief. Daniels and Ismail bowled tightly at the end and South Africa's fielders were on high alert to deny West Indies.", "label": 0}, "external-510": {"text": "strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices were steady on

So, the shift in sulphur specification is not expected to have a major impact on trade flows, middle distillates traders said.Pakistan is also moving towards 92-octane gasoline from November and is phasing out imports of 87-octane gasoline, one of the sources said.PSO is looking to potentially sign long-term contracts for gasoline cargoes, though this is not firm, the source added.

But their efforts were put to shade by Quinton de Kock, who made a bruising 51-ball 108, the first hundred in IPL 2016, to power Delhi Daredevils to a seven-wicket win at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.While De Kock starred in the lead role, Karun Nair, who hails from Bangalore, played the supporting role in 134-run third-wicket stand that came off 76 balls.Kohli showed he can be equally dangerous when setting targets. The groundwork was laid during the course of his second-wicket stand of 107 with de Villiers before Daredevils hit back with a tremendous exhibition of late-overs bowling courtesy the returning Mohammed Shami and Chris Morris, who conceded only 27 off the last four overs.Daredevils were dealt an early blow when Shreyas Iyer was dismissed by Shane Watson but it had little effect on de Kock as he pierced a packed off-side field for three fours off the offspinner Parvez Rasool in the second over.De Kock was particularly punishing through the off side, a majority of his runs coming behind square. Once he was set, the other elements to his game surfaced. A nonchalant flick off Harshal Patel in the ninth over soared over deep square leg, and once he was into the 90s he used the pace to scoop the ball over short fine leg. The end result was a wagon wheel with spokes all around the wicket.De Kock's sparkling form helped Daredevils ride a trough when Sanju Samson struggled to play his shots, but his dismissal in the sixth over turned their fortunes. Nair and de Kock got stuck in against Yuzvendra Chahal, Harshal Patel and David Wiese, whose combined tally at one point was 78 conceded off seven overs. Their predictability put immense pressure on Watson to deliver with the ball as the equation came down to 56 off the last six overs.De Kock brought up his century off his 48th ball. Once into the home stretch, there was a sense of inevitability to the game. After De Kock walked off to a round of applause from Watson, who had him caught behind, Duminy struck the winning runs, Chahal fielding his straight punch but giving away an overthrow with an underarm flick to try and catch Nair out of his crease.", "label": 0}, "external-669": {"text": "London: Oil prices fell on Tuesday as a global supply glut and soft demand overshadowed the impact of geopolitical tensions in the crude-rich Middle East, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in June slid 43 cents to $59 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for July shed 63 cents to stand at $65.64 a barrel in London afternoon deals.\"According to official data...

In a wicketless session that went for 102 runs, R Ashwin enjoyed some luck but also displayed some attractive shots; a back-foot punch for four through mid-on was the shot of the session. The partnership between the two swelled to 168.As was the case on day one, Gabriel bowled a short burst with the new ball, which was taken first thing in the morning. He tested Ashwin, who was dropped on 43 by Dowrich, who looked like he was already thinking of celebrating even before completing the simple catch. Jason Holder looked unremarkable at the other end; Carlos Brathwaite did a better job of testing the batsmen's patience with consistent bowling a set of stumps outside off stump.The tactic had kept India's top order quiet in the first session of the match, but Kohli didn't wait for too long before taking a calculated risk, which was executed so well it didn't look like a risk. Kohli has his own way of choosing what balls to drive. Each delivery of Brathwaite's first three overs was bowled to Kohli, who attempted to score off only one, the widest of the lot. It wasn't a half-volley either, but Kohli drove superbly on the up, and got a boundary to break any pressure the joining of dots creates.Cover driving, as usual, remained the feature of Kohli's innings. When he gave the treatment to Devendra Bishoo in the 105th over, the boundary took him past his previous best of 169; it was his 50th run through the covers. A sign of how well he batted came in how, in the 113th over, he played perhaps the only ungainly shot of his innings, a half-sweep across the line to deep midwicket. Turned out he had picked the rare wrong'un from Bishoo, and was actually playing with the spin.No Test double is easy, but in the last over before lunch, Kohli strolled to one of the more inevitable ones with an easy single off a short offbreak.

India's prime minister is under fire after a move to cancel large-denomination rupee notes amounting to 86 percent of the total outstanding by value. The bold step to fight corruption has left Indians queuing outside bank branches since Wednesday to swap old notes for legal tender, bringing parts of the nation's economy to a standstill.</strongThe pain is most palpable for the informal sector, which accounts for almost half of GDP and the vast majority of employment. Tendering old notes above a minimal value for new ones requires a bank account, but 40 percent of the population is outside of the formal banking system. No wonder tensions are running high.If Modi can ride out the immediate backlash, though, demonetisation could potentially provide a big fiscal boost. Suppose that holders of one-fifth of the notes in circulation will not try to exchange them out of fear of attracting scrutiny from tax authorities. That means currency worth almost $50 billion, or 2 percent of GDP, could suddenly become worthless.In theory that would sharply reduce the monetary liabilities of the Reserve Bank of India, and brokerage Edelweiss reckons that in turn could allow the central bank to pay a higher dividend to the government. Other economists suggest this may not be legally possible, but the RBI does face pressure each year to boost its payouts to New Delhi.A windfall could help India boost spending while meeting its ambitious plan to narrow the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP by March 2018.

Earlier, the foreign exchange markets also had their share in this global turmoil. Since the start of devaluation of Chinese Yuan on August 11, currency depreciation around the globe particularly in the developing countries has accelerated. Many of these countries have allowed their currencies to depreciate primarily to maintain their trade competitiveness against China. Pakistan is also a part of the global economies and cannot remain immune to the developments around the globe. This fact raised expectations about a possible impact on the domestic economy and a downward movement of the exchange rate. As a result on August 24, 2015 Pak Rupee depreciated against the US Dollar to close at Rs 104.50. This translates into a single day movement of the currency by 2.4 percent and a cumulative depreciation of 2.6% percent since the beginning of this fiscal year. It is important to realise that this positioning is driven by international currency movements and not due to any weakness in the domestic economy.

straight sets in the final of the Italian Open in Rome.</strongJust a week after Djokovic had beaten him in the final of the Madrid Open, the Scot gained his revenge over the world number one in another claycourt final with a superb 6-3 6-3 win in one hour and 35 minutes.Djokovic was not at his best and in a grumpy mood, complaining on several occasions to the umpire about the slippery court surface on a damp day at the Foro Italico.Yet the defeat, just his third of the entire season, could not be totally put down to hints of weariness from Djokovic after a tough week's work as he told Murray afterwards: \"Well done Andy, you were just too good.\"It was an emphatic triumph, after finishing runner-up in Madrid and making the semi-finals in Monte Carlo, to convince Murray that he now must have his best shot yet at winning the French Open, which begins next weekend.In the week that Murray announced an amicable split from coach Amelie Mauresmo, this was only the second time in their last 14 meetings that he had beaten Djokovic and it was his first victory in their six duels on clay.The light rain in the Italian capital really seemed to dampen Djokovic's spirit as he complained to the umpire that it was \"too dangerous\" to continue but his appeals were brushed aside by the official, Damian Steiner.Murray was aggressive from the start, taking command in the light drizzle, and even when Djokovic appeared to be fighting back in the second set, Murray saved break points in successive games to begin imposing himself again.At the end, Djokovic capitulated with surprising swiftness, hitting a couple of errant forehands and a double fault at 3-5 down before Murray conjured up one inspirational backhand winner from way beyond the tramlines to lift the title.No British man had won the Italian title since Patrick Hughes in 1931 and the triumph will put Murray into the world number two spot on Monday ahead of Roger Federer before the second of the season's slams
